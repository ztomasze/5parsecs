#### Battle conditions & special rules

+ **Goal:** Fight off
+ **Delayed:** 2 random crew members (Jean, Chirp) won’t start on the table. At the end of each round, roll 1D6: If the roll is equal or below the round number, they may be placed at any point of your own battlefield edge.
+ **Person of interest:** +1 story point
+ **Respawn:** On enemy death, roll a d6 and the creature respawns d6" in a random direction on a result of (8-WT).
    1. If killed in Fast phase, they respawn in the Enemy phase. Respawning consumes their turn that phase.
    2. If killed in Slow phase, they respawn at the end of the phase.
    3. A respawned enemy does not count as dead for purposes of panic or battlefield finds.
+ Reinforcements: +1 grunt, +1 specialt
+ Old supply drops - "crates and craters" in a war zone. 
	+ difficult terrain patches. 
	+ we're tracking down clues of a past incident on Aries 7
	+ separated in pairs (two pairs here; third is delayed - Jean and Chirp found the stuff, but have to race back to help the rest of the ambushed team)
