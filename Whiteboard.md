**Gunslingers** - **Trick shot:** Any natural 6 when they shoot allows an additional shot against the same target or another target within 2”.

**Secret Agent** -  **Target:** Randomly select a crew member: **Jean** The agent will attempt to move towards and attack them, only firing at other targets if they are in the way or the priority target is not visible. May fire at the priority target, even if it is not the closest.

#### Battle conditions & special rules

+ **Goal:** Standoff / Hold the Field
+ Idea: Start with the ship on end and they come in.  3 grunts prioritize damaging the ship.
+ **Respawn:** On enemy death, roll a d6 and the creature respawns d6" in a random direction on a result of (8-WT). 
	1. If killed in Fast phase, they respawn in the Enemy phase. Respawning consumes their turn that phase. 
	2. If killed in Slow phase, they respawn at the end of the phase.
	3. A respawned enemy does not count as dead for purposes of panic or battlefield finds.
