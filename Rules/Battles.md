Increase **Numbers** by +1 if enemy entry has:

- Combat Skill +0 AND Toughness 3
- Panic 1-3

Roll on following table ([[World Tier]] - 1) times. +1 roll if in a Red Zone. Reroll any duplicate results.

## Battle Round

**Seize the Initiative**:

+ *Fail:* No one can go Fast in the first round.
+ *Succeed:* Normal Seize round (only move or action, shots only hit on a 6)
+ *Super Seize* (requires [[Advanced Training|Security Training]]; beat target by +3): Each character rolls a d6 <= reaction to take a normal turn instead of a seize round.
+ *Super-Duper Seize* (natural 12 and beat by +3): As super seize, but each character gets a normal turn (no reaction roll needed).  Can also try for a Superdy-Duperdy Seize.
+ *Superdy-Duperdy Seize* (super-duper seize followed by another natural 12): Automatically win in the mission.  Each character picks one item from the loot table.

## Battle Events

At the end of each round after the first, roll a d6. On a 5+, an event occurs.

## Salvage Missions

Generate rooms on the fly.  (Can override the roll if it doesn't fit or make sense.)

| d6    | Size     | Additional exits | Room size (# of hexes) |
| ----- | -------- | ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| 1     | dead-end | 0                | d4+2                   |
| 2     | small    | 1                | d4+2                   |
| 3 - 4 | medium   | 2                | d6+6                   |
| 5 - 6 | large    | 3                | d8+12                  |
