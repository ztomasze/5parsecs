**Intent:** *I want to discourage enemies from entering my turf and punish them if they do.*

* I have a home turf, which corresponds to my starting half of the map.
* I follow a [[Rules/Cautious|Cautious]] AI until an opposing figure enters my turf.  I then switch to [[Rules/Aggressive|Aggressive]] for the remainder of the mission.

**Setup:** In 3 groups, with 8" between each group and 1 to 2" between figures in a group.
