All trainings cost 15 XP/credits.  A character can only purchase one of these trainings.

##### Pilot training
* When rolling for a new world during New World Arrival, roll twice and pick one.
* You automatically succeed any Savvy roll on the Starship Travel events table.

##### Medical school
* After each battle, you may nominate a casualty that will roll twice on the Injury Table, picking the better result. This crew member must have been in the battle and must not have become a casualty. (If your ship has a Shuttle, you can evac fast enough that this crew member can apply their skill even if they did not participate in the battle.)

##### Security training
* If this crew member is part of your squad when fighting a battle, you may add +1 when rolling to Seize the Initiative.
