In addition to the existing [[Advanced Training]] options, characters may take training in one Combat Class.

* The advanced training application for a combat class is only required one time.
* Each feat in a combat class then costs 10 XP each. Non-bot characters may only spend experience for this, not credits. 
* Characters may take the feats from a class in any order. 
* The number of feats a character may gain is limited to the current [[World Tier]].
* Precursors may take feats from multiple combat classes, but are still limited to one feat per world tier.

**Class Benefits:** Some combat classes have additional benefits unlocked by taking one or more feats from that class.

**Training Benefits:** A character may purchase specific equipment as part of the training. Each training benefit can be purchased only once. A Training Benefit (2+) can only be purchased when learning your 2nd or later feat in the class.

**Training Requirements:** This is specific gear required to take a course. This requirement can be satisfied by purchasing the gear provided by a Training Benefit (1+) if needed.
