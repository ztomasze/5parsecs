**Intent:** *I want to defend with my bonded companion.*

* I will follow my attached companion, minimizing my exposure while remaining with 3" of them.
* Whenever possible, I will attack the same target as my companion, using the same method (shooting or brawling)
* If I or my companion are hit, I will switch to my secondary AI, which is either [[Beast]] or [[Aggressive]], as appropriate to my creature type. I will then treat the figure that made that attack as my sole "nearest opponent" until either it or I are dead.
* I will remain in my secondary AI for the remainder of the mission.

**Setup:** Adjacent to its attached companion.
