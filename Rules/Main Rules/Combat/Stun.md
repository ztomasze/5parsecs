If you are stunned, you gain 1 Stun marker. While you have one or more Stun markers:

- You can perform either a Move OR a primary action on your turn (with the exception of Brawling, which can still be performed).
- You cannot Aim or Snap Fire.
- When Brawling, your Hits deal -1 damage for each Stun marker that you have.

If you are stunned again, you gain an additional Stun marker. If you reach your Stun threshold, you become a casualty.Â  

Stun thresholds:

- Characters: 3 (unless raised with a feat)
- Enemy figures: 2+WT

Remove one Stun marker at the end of your activation. A Stun marker gained during your activation will not be removed until your next activation.
