When you are [[Hit]] or otherwise affected by an attack or event (such as [[Stun|stunned]]), you can spend 1 Luck point to negate that effect. This also prevents any remaining Hits or effects that have not yet been resolved from that attack or event.

For example:

- You can prevent the Stun of a dazzle grenade or the hit taken from falling.
- Preventing the first hit from a Critical weapon shot also prevents the second hit. However, using Luck on the second hit does not retroactively undo the effects of the first hit.
- Preventing a hit taken from Brawling also prevents any remaining hits, such as in the case where you lost the brawl and a natural 1 or 6 or both were involved.
- Luck cannot prevent more than one shot from a multi-shot weapon, as each shot is resolved separately.

Enemies only apply Luck when they would become a casualty.

Upon applying a Luck point, that figure can move 1" in any direction as they dive for cover.

#### Recovering Luck
Once used, Luck points do not automatically recharge. During the Upkeep phase of a campaign turn, roll a d6: On 5-6, regain one luck point. After the roll, you may add to the roll at the cost of 1 XP per point added. You cannot make this roll if you are in sick bay or otherwise unable to participate in crew tasks this turn.

#### Luck Maximum
Characters are limited to a maximum of 1 Luck point, except for Humans, who can have up to 2 Luck.
