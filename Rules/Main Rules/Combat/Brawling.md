To start a brawl, the attacking figure must Move into an enemy figure's space and then take the Brawling combat action.

- Remember which hex edge the attacker crossed to start the brawl. 
- You cannot enter a brawl through an ally-occupied hex unless one of the adjacent hexes on either side of the crossed edge is empty.

Each brawling combatant rolls a D6 modified by:

- +Combat Skill (Brawling)
- +/- any weapon or modifiers (such as +1 for Pistol or +2 for a Melee weapon)

Result:

- The lower roll suffers one [[Hit]]. On a tie, both combatants suffer one [[Hit]].
- On a natural 6, the opposing combatant suffers one [[Hit]] (cumulative)
- On a natural 1, that combatant suffers one [[Hit]] (cumulative)

Resolve the Hit's damage based on the weapon used in the brawl. If you did not use either a Melee or Pistol weapon, your Hit(s) deal Damage +0 with no weapon traits.

If both figures are still standing, the attacker can push the defender out of the hex on a win or else must step back:

- Upon winning the brawl, the attacker can choose to push the defender back one hex into an empty hex. "Backward" is across the hex edge opposite the edge crossed to start the brawl, or across either of its two adjacent edges. Enemy figures always choose to push if they can.
- If the defender cannot be pushed backward due to obstacles or other figures, if the attacker lost the brawl, or if the attacker chooses not to push, the attacker must step back instead. This takes the attacker back across the entering edge or into one of the two adjacent hexes on either side of it. 
- In the case of a tie, the attacker must step back.

#### Pack Hunters

**Swarm Brood** is currently the sole example. 

+ Pack hunters end their movement in your space but resolve any attack at the end of the enemy phase.  There is no limit to the number who can enter you hex this way.
+ At the end of monster phase, resolve the brawling attack of each pack member in your hex.  The first member attacks with its normal bonus, the second gains a +1, the third +2, and so on. After resolving the attack, that pack member moves "back" to the nearest open hex.
+ If you spend a luck point AND use it to move, all pack members in your hex who have not yet attacked will freely move with you. This resets the swarm bonus of the next attack back to +0 (reflecting the smaller pack that is still on you).
