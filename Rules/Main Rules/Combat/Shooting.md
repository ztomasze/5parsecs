Roll a D6 modified by:

* +Combat Skill (Shooting)
* +/- any equipment modifiers (such as Pistol, Snap Shot, sights, etc)
* -1 if the target has [[../Line of Sight and Cover|Cover]]
* -any range penalties

If the result is 5+, the shot inflicts a [[Hit]] on the target. 

#### Aiming
If a figure forsakes its available Move this turn, it can reroll any 1 on a shooting roll once.

#### Multi-shot weapons
Resolve one shot at a time. If shooting at multiple targets, the next target must be within 3" from all previous targets.
