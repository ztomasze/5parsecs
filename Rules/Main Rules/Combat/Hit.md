When you take a Hit, first roll any [[Saving Throw]] that can be applied to the attack:

- On a success, the Hit is prevented without any further effect.

If the hit was not prevented, roll **damage**: d6 + any damage bonus from the attack or effect and compare the result to your Toughness:

- Damage < Toughness: Gain 1 [[Stun]]
- Damage = Toughness: Gain 1 [[Stun]] + 1 [[Wound]]
- Damage > Toughness: You are a Casualty (removed from the board)


> **Dropped**  
> - 1" push back on each hit
