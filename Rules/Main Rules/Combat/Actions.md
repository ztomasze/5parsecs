When acting, a figure can normally make one **Move** (see [[Movement]]) and then one **Primary Action**.

Your primary action can be one of these types:

* **Combat Action**
    * **Shoot** - See [[Shooting]] rules
    * **Brawl** - See [[Brawling]] rules
* **Dash** - Move 2". You can only Dash if you used your Move to make a normal movement.
* **Non-Combat Action** - Required to use certain items or to interact with some environmental features.

You can also perform one **Free Action** any time during your activation, such as using a consumable. Performing a second Free Action requires your primary action.

(See [[Stun]] for its effects on actions.)

### Combat Skill

Combat Skil (CS) is now broken into two skills for characters--Shooting and Brawling--which are improved separately. Enemies continue to have only a single Combat Skill that they use for both.

* Base improvements to your CS (such as from your [[../../Crew Types|crew type]]) increase both.
* When gaining +CS through a Background, Motivation, or Class, choose which of CSS (Shooting) or CSB (Brawling) to increase.
* CSS and CSB cannot be increased above the [[World Tier]] by spending experience. If a character exceeds the World Tier limit from other sources (like Background), then they convert this benefit to either Speed, Toughness, or Reactions instead.
