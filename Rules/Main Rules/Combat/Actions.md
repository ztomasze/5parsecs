When acting, a figure can normally make one **Move** (see [[Movement]]) and then one **Primary Action**.

Your primary action can be one of these types:

* **Combat Action**
    * **Shoot** - See [[Shooting]] rules
    * **Brawl** - See [[Brawling]] rules
* **Dash** - Move 2"
* **Non-Combat Action** - Required to use certain items or to interact with some environmental features.

You can also perform one **Free Action** any time during your activation, such as using a consumable. Performing a second Free Action requires your primary action.

(See [[Stun]] for its effects on actions.)
