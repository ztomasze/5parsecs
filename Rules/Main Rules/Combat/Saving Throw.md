Roll a d6 with a result >= to your Saving Throw value to deflect an incoming hit.

Saving throws can come from screens or armor.

If you have multiple saving throws that apply to the current attack, start with the best (lowest) one and then improve that score by 1.

- Bots, Soulless, De-converted, and Assault Bots have built-in armor. This can be combined with a regular suit of armor.
