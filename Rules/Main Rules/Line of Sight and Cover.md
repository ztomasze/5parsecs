In general, just eyeball it from the perspective of the shooting figure.  

When in doubt, favor granting both line-of-sight (LoS) and cover.

#### Shooting across/over

* Obstacles and hex stacks of 4 or more breaks LoS.
* 2 hexes high or more provides cover. 
	* You can ignore a hex stack of height < 4 that is adjacent to the attacker when determining cover.
* You can shoot over 1-hex heights.

#### Shooting past/around

* If you can't see the head or torso of the target figure, you have no LoS.
* If part of the head and torso is obscured, they have cover. 
* If you can see the complete head and torso, no cover. 

#### Shooting past people

* Figures break LoS if your shot follows a "brute" line (straight line of hexes) through them. 
* Figures never provide cover.

#### Area features

* Shooting through an Area hex breaks LoS
* A figure in an edge hex can see and be seen from outside the area. 
* Two figures within an area can see each other if they are adjacent. 
* A figure in an Area always has cover.
