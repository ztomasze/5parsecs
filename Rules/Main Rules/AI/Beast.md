**Intent:** *I want to end every turn closer to my nearest opponent so that I can eventually brawl.*

**Target:** Nearest opponent

- I will reduce exposure along the way (provided I can still end closer), but not at the expense of attacking this turn.
- I prefer to stay within 2" of an ally and to attack the same target.

**Will brawl?** Always.
