**Intent:** *I want to end every turn closer to my nearest opponent so that I can eventually brawl.*

**Target:** Nearest opponent

- I will reduce exposure along the way (provided I can still end closer), but not at the expense of attacking this turn.
- I prefer to stay within 2" of an ally and to attack the same target.

**Will brawl?** Always. 

**Setup:** Place into 3 groups, evenly spaced across the table. Prefer pairs, with 2" between figures. Groups do not need to be on the enemy edge, but they do still need to be 18" from characters.
