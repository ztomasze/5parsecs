**Intent:** *I want to attack whatever I can as I close to within 6" of my nearest opponent and then shoot or brawl there.*

**Target:** Nearest opponent

* If further than 6" from my nearest opponent, I will advance. I will reduce exposure and/or shoot so long as I end my turn closer to my target.
* If I'm stunned but I can shoot something, then I will attack over moving.
* I prefer improving my attack modifier over reducing my exposure.
* Once within 6", I will move either to brawl (if I am willing to engage) or to reduce exposure while remaining within 6" of my target.

**Will brawl?** If my Brawling is **>=** my target's.
* Gains a Blade if given no other melee weapon.

**Special Ability:** ***Up close and personal*** - If armed with a non-Pistol gun, that gun gains Snapshot (+1 to hit within 6").
