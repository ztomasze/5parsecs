**Intent:** *I want to discourage enemies from entering my turf and punish them if they do.*

* I have a home turf, which generally corresponds to my starting half of the map.
* I follow a [[Cautious|Cautious]] AI until an opposing figure enters my turf.  I then switch to [[Aggressive|Aggressive]] for the remainder of the mission.
