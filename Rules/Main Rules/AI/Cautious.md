**Intent:** *I want to maximize cover and distance from my enemies while I attack them.*

**Target:** Line of Fire (LoF)

* If it is impossible to make an attack this turn, I will move as far as I can in that direction this turn, favoring the destination with the least exposure.
* If I can make an attack this turn, I prefer to also:
	1. Move to reduce my exposure (even if that results in a lower attack modifier this turn, so long as I can still possibly hit)
	2. Move to increase my distance from the nearest opponent (but not if it increases my attack's range penalty)
	3. Move to increase my attack modifier, such as by reducing cover or range penalties
	4. Aim
	5. Attack a closer target

**Will brawl?** No. 

**Setup:** In 2 groups, with 6" between them and 2" between figures in a group.
