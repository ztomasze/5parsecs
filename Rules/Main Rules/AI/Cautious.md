**Intent:** *I want to maximize cover and distance from my enemies while I attack them.*

**Target:** Line of Fire (LoF)

* If it is impossible to make an attack this turn:
	1. Move to minimize the number of turns until I can make an attack
	2. Move to minimize exposure
* If I can make an attack this turn, I prefer to also:
	1. Move to reduce my exposure (even if that results in a lower attack modifier this turn, so long as I can still possibly hit)
	2. Avoid decreasing my attack modifier
	3. Move to increase my attack modifier
	4. Move to increase my distance from the nearest opponent
	5. Move the shortest distance

**Will brawl?** No.
