**Intent:** *I want to make the most effective attacks while making an optimal use of range and cover.*

**Target:** Line of Fire (LoF)

* If it is impossible to make an attack this turn, I will move in that direction this turn, favoring the destination with the least exposure.
* If I can make an attack this turn, I prefer to also:
	1. Avoid decreasing my attack modifier
	2. Move to reduce my exposure
	3. Move to increase my attack modifier. (I will also move if it gets me closer to an eventually improved attack modifier, such as closer to pistol range.)
	4. Move the shortest distance

**Will brawl?** If my Brawling is **>** my target's.
