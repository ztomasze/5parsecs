**Intent:** *I want to homicidally rush to the nearest opponent to brawl.*

**Target:** Nearest opponent

- I will not swerve from my path in order to decrease exposure. 
- If I have a ranged weapon, I will shoot at the target I am currently rushing toward (instead of dashing).

**Will brawl?** Always.
* Gains a Blade if given no other melee weapon.
