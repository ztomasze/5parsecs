**Intent:** *I want to defend with my bonded companion.*

* I will follow my attached companion, minimizing my exposure while remaining with 3" of them.
* Whenever possible, I will attack the same target as my companion, using the same method (shooting or brawling)
* If I or my companion are the target of an attack, I will switch to my secondary AI, which is either [[Beast]] or [[Aggressive]], as appropriate to my creature type. 
* If my companion dies, I become [[Rampaging]] where my target is the figure that killed my companion.

**Setup:** Adjacent to its attached companion.
