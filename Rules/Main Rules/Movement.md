Each figure has a Speed that specifies the number of inches they can move with a Move action.Â 

It costs 1" of movement to move from one hex to another over normal ground.

##### Through Figures
A figure can move through (but not stop in) a hex occupied by an ally. A figure cannot enter an enemy figure's hex except as part of a Brawl action.

##### Difficult Terrain
Moving into a hex of difficult terrain costs an additional 1" of movement.  If you fall into difficult terrain, you must pay this additional cost if you continue moving this turn.

##### Climbing
You can climb up or down a hex face at the cost of 1" of movement per hex.  When climbing up, you ignore the cost of the first hex in the stack. You cannot end your move part way up.

##### Falling & Jumping Down
Falling down takes no movement. You can fall 3" without penalty.  If you fall 4" or more, you take a +0 Damage hit, with +1 to the Damage for each additional hex fallen. Saving Throws do not apply to a falling Hit.

##### Leaping & Jumping Across
Figures can leap over a gap 1 hex wide as part of their movement. You can only jump laterally, not up or down. If you fall at the end of the jump, follow normally falling rules from there. You cannot jump over difficult terrain.

##### Random Movement
Roll a d12 to determine a "clock" direction from the current hex and move in a straight line the distance specified by the effect. The figure will navigate around terrain to end as close as possible to the destination hex.

##### Forced Movement
If a figure is forcibly or bodily moved by an effect into contact with an obstacle, they stop moving and are stunned. If they contact another figure, they stop moving; the figure they collided with is also stunned.

###### Alternative Movement
(See the rules of the corresponding effect that allows or produces it.)

##### Enemy Movement
See [[Main Rules/AI/AI Rules|AI Rules]].
