We use Heroscape tiles and obstacles (with these approximate mappings to original types):

* **fence** (linear) - Provides cover; can't stand on. Takes 1" extra movement to hop over.
* **tree, iceberg** (individual/"obstacle") - Can't climb or stand on.
	* A hex-stack capped with a thin hex also counts as an obstacle like this.
* **thin hexes on the ground**
	* generally blue (Area) = steam cloud, mist, vapors.  Blocks LoS (as below), not difficult terrain.
	* generally dark green (field) = mud, rubble, etc. Difficult terrain, does not block LoS.
	* (others/ad hoc) = Counts as both Area + Field.
	* (others/ad hoc) = Impassable (can't be crossed except in flight, jump, etc)
* **hex stacks** (block, interior) - climbable; can enter

See [[Movement]] for difficult terrain rules.
