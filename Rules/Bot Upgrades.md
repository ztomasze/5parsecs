Any of the following upgrades may be applied to a Bot character for the listed cost during
post-battle step 11. Purchase Items. Only one upgrade can be installed per campaign turn. The Mechanic Advanced Training applies to these costs.

A Bot character can have one of each upgrade installed over time. They are lost if the
character is permanently destroyed (“Killed”), and cannot later be replaced or transferred.
Note that Soulless characters cannot use these upgrades, as their physical shells use a
different technological base.
