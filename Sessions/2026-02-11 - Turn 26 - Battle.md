#### Battle

+ A nice quiet delivery job when we are suddenly ambushed on an outdoor market district street.
+ 0) We super seize the turn, but mostly just run to the left for cover while Gizmo drops a smoke grenade.
+ 1) We're on the back foot and hunker down for a moment. A shot fired through the smoke knocks Billie back. We hunker down, cringing back into cover.
+ 2) They move up.  A shot whines over R9's head. The enemies move in. Chirp executes one from the bell tower. Billie runs in and kills one, cleaving through to kill another. Gizmo tosses off the grenade. R9 stops out, blows shots through a fence, and stuns a lt. specialist. Jean steps up the fence and wounds the two with him.  One gets back up.  (Seize the moment: Julie)
+ 3) Jean finishes off the wounded ones.  Billie scrambles up on to the roof, but stumbles and fails to drop the two snipers up there. R9 provides cover fire for Julie to jump out on the unique. Billie dances back from sniper fire.  Jean gets blown back and wounded by a fury rifle blast, as does R9.  Chirp stim-packs a hit on him. Gimzo runs forward past the smoke. Chirp pops a still and drops the sniper that shot him. 3 panic away.  (Ammo fault: Gizmo.)  Significant reinforcements: 3 more!
+ 4) Julie, Jean, and R9 focus on the reinforcements. R9 gets rocked back by another fury rifle blast, and Julie takes a couple shots, stim-packing to stay on her feet. Billie struggles up on the top of the building.  Chirp executes another one, and his friend panics away. A new guy comes in with a coffee and croissant. (Renewed efforts!)
+ 5) Jean and Julie drop the reinforcements. Chirp drops the new guys (Mr. Croissant.)  R9 misses. Billie drops one.  Billie takes some shots. Billie jumps on him and kills him, but takes a wound in return.  (Environmental hazard!) Bell tower starts shaking!
