### Battle

Khanda filled me in on the details when the crew returned. They dropped stealthily into the Lordly Lads' training ground with the engines throttled low. They should have had the advantage, but then they tripped a wire as they exited the ship and an alarm started blaring. They advanced through the Carpathian gloom, guided by their wrist slate motion sensors. 

Rosey received the first shot and returned fire, putting down one the Lads hard. (Still, Rosey confided later, it was a survivable shot, assuming prompt medical attention.). Twitch quickly took our their lieutenant, but the Lads, to their credit, didn't panic or break for cover. 

The rest of the crew swarmed the greatest danger identified on the field: a scrawny Lad with a big shell gun. Khanda put my cling fire gun to good use and neutralized the threat. 

The crew then advanced on a small bridge and the second group of Lads that were dug in there. Khanjar rushed in, waving his pistol around, and Khanda backed him up. 

Then a Lad they hadn't really been tracking stepped out of a small thicket hefting a rattle gun. Although Khanjar dove for cover, several shots deflected off his armor, leaving him bruised and sore. Rosey rushed to his rescue and ended it.

### Post-Battle

The crew quickly swept the training grounds, looting 6 credits worth of spare equipment. They also found a damaged beam pistol and three damaged frak grenades.

After this assault and equipment confiscation, we didn't expect the Lads to come looking for us again any time soon _(rival removed)_. 

Twitch also found an encrypted data stick that showed that the Lads had contracted training from the Blood Storms - a most fortuitous coincidence! There was contact info here and details about a facility of theirs in west Bacau (_2_? _rumors_). 

Overall, the team did well without me. Twitch seems ever more _savvy_ with the tech, and both Khanda and Simon are getting more comfortable with their _combat_ firearms. 

Only Khanjar seemed disappointed with the mission. Angry at his own shooting performance and his near injury, he glowered and sulked around the ship. He started tinkering with a stuck internal door we have. There's a short in the motion sensor somewhere and so sometimes you have to fall back to the manual slide. This infuriated Khanjar this evening, so he hauled out the wiring tools and pried open the door's service panel. In his funk, he managed to create an arc that blew out half the door frame and left a black sooty mess that extended up into the ceiling duct above. We also had to haul out one of the med patches to deal with the electrical burns that ran up his forearms. I think Rosey dialed up the pain suppressors a couple extra clicks, because Khanjar soon nodded off. He woke a little chagrined but more like his usual self.

While Khanjar was out, we liquidated the confiscated Lads gear, as well as two batches of spare parts that Twitch had accumulated. While haggling in an alley bazaar, we met an offworld alien of a type I haven't seen before. Although his trade offer was clear enough through his mechanical translator, we declined his offer of exotic trade parts.

## Turn #7

With the inquest wrapping up, we were soon free to work again. We discussed casing western Bacau to see if we could zero in on the Blood Storms' safehouse, but we decided we would take on any other well-paying jobs in the meantime.

### World 

In preparation, **Twitch** _repaired_ some of our damaged gear. **Simon** and **Rosey** headed out for _trade_ supplies. Simon picked up a trio of grenades, and Rosey either found a flea market or did some dumpster diving because she came back with a broken hover board and an inert flak screen. Still, Twitch might be able to do something with them. **Khanda** and **Khanjar** hit the _training_ sims. 

### Job

**I** checked my cortex messages. Bosch from DIRM had sent me a vague message about a possible job.  It paid well _(+3 cr)_ and we had to be _clean_, but it could wait for us (_this or next 2 turns_). I replied that we'd do it as soon as we wrapped up our inquest, to his point about not having any criminal record. 

I then headed back out to **Medias** to sign the last of the inquest paperwork. As we finished up, I was slightly surprised when the judge asked me to join him in his chambers. 

His chambers were richly appointed, with a thick burgundy pile carpet, mahogany desk, and dark leather chairs and sofa. He poured us each a crystal tumbler of whiskey, and he took his place behind his wide desk. He leaned his girth back into the overstuffed chair with a soft creak of leather and gazed at me while I nursed my whiskey. With his white hair, black rim glasses, and string bow tie, **Judge Sandok** reminded me very much of a particular fastfood chicken chain mascot, although twice as wide.

"Mr. Walker," he began, "I want to say that, while certain members of the local law enforcement might favor these Lordly Lads miscreants, the judiciary"--and here he placed a plump hand on his chest--"does not. Furthermore, I can appreciate the value of clearing out certain riffraff elements before they can sink their roots too deeply into our peaceful community. In the context of some of my non-judiciary business ventures, I find myself in exactly that situation. I have conducted my own background check of you and your crew, Mr. Walker, and find you to have sound references (_prior patron job in this world_) and a reputation for getting the job done. I would like to hire you for a discreet but _urgent_ job."

While Medias is a very small pond, I could tell that Judge Sandok was a very prominent fish in that pond. Given his connections, both legal and commerical, he could be a valuable Carpathium patron. I also got the feeling that he was not accustomed to being told no. With the warmth of his mellow whiskey still in my throat, I said I'd be happy to discuss the details of doing a job for him.

"Excellent. These Lordly Lads were receiving military training from an off-world mercenary group. An auxiliary band of local ganger misfits who call themselves _An-R-key_ joined them in that training." 

I perked up at that.  This could lead to more Blood Storm _documents (rumor)_ on the battlefield.

"An-R-key has recently moved into a warehouse of mine, laying claim to the commercial stores there. As you know, the local law enforcement can be unreliable in their sympathies. I could request support from Bacau, but I prefer to keep our local affairs local." 

I wondered just what the judge had in this warehouse. Best not for us to go in blind, but I put the question to him delicately.

He waved a hand dismissively. "Oh, all manner of luxury and trade goods. Many of the items were claimed through police auctions and estate closures. Nothing illegal, I assure you."

Still, perhaps not something the judge would want anyone looking at too closely. I understand that buying at auction can be very lucrative when you are the sole bidder, for example. 

"These gangers are a vindictive crew. I'll pay you _2 credits_ up front, plus a bonus when they've been cleared from the warehouse. Some of them have bounties on their heads, which may further sweeten the pot for you. I can also offer you a pick from the _store_ of goods in the warehouse. Given that your ship is now well-known in the area, I prefer that your team use _private transport_ that I can provide in order to maintain a certain level of discretion."

I said I'd contact my team right away.  Sandok smiled thickly, like a cat that's just finished the cream. Instead of shaking on it, he gently clinked his crystal tumbler against mine.

I got on the vox and the Tail-End flew in about an hour later.  Khanda put it down in a forest meadow east of the town limit. 

I rode out to pick up the team in a battered nondescript transport that was driven by a bearded chauffeur. He nodded at me in the rear view mirror, but he remained silent through both the drive to the Tail-End and our return. 

The chauffeur pulled over to the side of a rural road a few hundred yards from a rust-stained warehouse. He looked back over his shoulder at us crowded in the transport's long passenger bay, and then he pointed to the warehouse ahead. Behind the warehouse, moss-covered trees stretched off into a shaggy wetland.

We stepped from the vehicle and fanned out, making our way to the warehouse. Our approach was halfway between a leisurely stroll along a country road and a covert team pincer maneuver. 

As we neared, I could hear a heavy bass track and loud voices from within. We took up our positions. Then Rosey and I stepped forward, and she clanged loudly on the metal door. The music dropped in volume, and the door pushed open.

Inside, among the stacked crates and tarp-covered transports, I made out six slinking gangers.  Most leveled colony rifles at us, though one of them looked eager to fire up the oversized ripper sword he was cradling. A woman with short red-dyed hair and and dressed in camo trousers and a tight leather top stepped forward. She carried her rifle more competently than the rest.

Before she could speak, I raised a hand. "By order of Judge Sandok, you are to vacate these premises immediately."

She skillfully raised her rifle muzzle toward me in one hand while reaching down to grab the front of her camo pants with the other.  "Judge Sandok can suck my…"

I cut her off with a blast of cling fire over her head while I simultaneously dove behind a crate. I can multitask too, and I grow tired of banter. 

My eviction notice, underscored with fire, was received about as well as I expected. A hail of rifle bullets cut through the warehouse air in reply.
