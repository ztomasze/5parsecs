### Ship's Log

#### Battle

+ Another delivery job interrupted, this time by a a group of gene renegades running a "most dangerous game" session.
+ Jean sprints forward and tosses a grenade to fill the alleyway with smoke. The renegades move into the smoke. Billie runs in and comes back out coughing. The rest of us move up.
+ Jean and Billie dive in, Billie cleaving into the Lt, dropping him. His guardian dog leaps on Billie, who kills it.  Chirp executes one of the hyper blaster wielders on the balcony across the alleyway.
+ A couple shots out of the smoke at Billie and Jean, while Chirp kills the other balcony hyper blaster. Billie kills a couple, and R9 drops another with 3 shots.  Julie kills the last hyper blaster and the last one, with one shot each.
+ Suddenly, 2 vent crawlers leap from the sewers!  Jean and R9 quickly excute them.
