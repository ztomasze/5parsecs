_Ordered dinner later and got some Mend'o Farms on the Shire side.  Remote play seems to be working fine._

### Battle

We rushed in quickly between the trees, but the tech gangers picked us up on their sensors before we could close to range. They dove to cover behind the trees.  They didn't call out or question us. They simply clicked off the safeties of their hand lasers and started firing. Things quickly devolved into a firefight.

Khanjar roared over our heads on his hoverboard, dropping down on the leader next to our target. Khanjar's attack was brutal, but it barely made it through this guy's armor. Khanjar had to dive to the dirt to avoid the leader's return blast.

Rosey stunned another of the gangers, and Khanda's shots pinged off of armor.  I stepped up and immolated the wounded leader before he could bring his blade down on Khanjar.

The rest of the tech gangers returned fire.  Multiple laser shots deflected off of Khanjar and Rosey's armor. Then Twitch took aim and blew the implant off of our target. The ganger's eyes rolled back, and he dropped dead to the ground. Our mission was accomplished.

One of the gangers turned and fled into the dark, but the remaining two turned on us. It looked like we'd have to fight our way out. 

Khanjar leapt up from the ground and sliced the hand off of one of them, while Rosey's shot forced the other to duck. As the wounded one brought his laser around on Khanjar, I cauterized his wrist for him, along with the rest of his body.  Khanda finished Rosey's work on the other.

Scanning the trees, I whirled around to be sure the field was clear. I saw Twitch standing up from one of the bodies.  He held a bloody augment in his hand: "Looks like they're not all xenotech, Captain. This one could be valuable."

I let out a long breath and holstered my cling fire gun.

### Post-Battle

Twitch stripped more of the bodies, but most of the gear was either damaged or suspect, so he ended up with just a pile of _spare parts_ that he'd sell. 

We then slipped quickly back through the arboretum. That had turned into an unsettlingly bloody job, but that's the nature of this work sometimes.  I'll just need to be +_tough_ to get through it. Khanjar ruminated on his lucky save, and I later saw him practice dual-wielding his gun and blade for future assaults like that _(+CS)_.

The next morning, I paid Bosch a visit to hand over the smashed xenotech implant. He paid me a four-credit bonus on top of the three he'd deposited before the job.  He also slid a requisition slip across his desk.  It turns out they had a few spare _ship parts_ stored down at the spaceport near our hangar.  That'd be useful as we finished up the repairs on the Tail-End.

When I returned to the ship, Simon was gone. He'd enrolled in some intensive Merchant Business Administration course. I can only hope that'll improve the quality of the trades he's been making lately.

Twitch flagged me down as I passed through the corridor and waved me into his berth.  The wall was covered in display screens and his desk covered in empty takeout food bins.  

"Captain," he opened, "you said you wanted me to look for the Blood Storm mercenaries. Well, I've done that. I've let you know each time I found a clue, and I told you last week that I've got all the info we need. But just to lay it all out for ya: Their base is here, in western Bacau."  He pointed at one of the displays and then zoomed in the map view there. "Here, in this little four block neighborhood called **Stitches**.  They've got a basement facility." He pulled up images of a huge warehouse-like interior. "I've been able to pull basic schematics from the city registrar.  The entrance is here, right behind this herb store--Smokin' Toke--on the surface."

Twitch pointed to another display and began flipping through spreadsheets and documents there. "Here are their two registered ships, and their recent flight paths. Here's a partial personnel list. Here's their training group contacts--two of which we've already engaged."

He tapped on the map display again. "There they are, Captain. Secure in their den. But they've got another contract with a feeder group called **Black Stone**." Twitch glanced over at me. "Nice use of the opening letters and lengths of words. Interested candidates join Black Stone. They complete training courses and basic mercenary work there. The best are then invited to join Blood Storm. This is how we get in: The top tier Black Stone candidates are granted badge access to the Blood Storm facility to come schmooze and get to know the boys. We get some of those cards, and we can walk in through the front door."

He leaned back in his chair.  "Like I said, Captain: That's everything you need to move forward with this job. Wait much longer, though, and they could jump planet. Now I'm going to work on other projects until you make up your mind that you actually want this revenge trip. When you do, you let me know."

With that, Twitch dropped some large headphones over his ears and turned back to his console.

I walked outside into the hangar and took a seat on one of the three lawn chairs we'd parked under the port wing.  I lit a cigar.  It's an old affectation from when I was a 20-year-old lieutenant projecting that I was old enough to command the lives of 20 enlisted men. I thought about Holrith's Crater, I thought about Wendy, and I thought about my crew.

Sudden motion in the shadows on the far side of the hangar brought me to my feet.  A silent silver snooper drone ducked back out of sight. I laid my hand on the butt of my cling fire gun.

"Forgive me, Mr. Walker. I did not mean to surprise you." I spun to my left and spotted a woman in a lightly plated body glove watching me. She wore a short blade at the curve of her hip, and the curve of her long red hair nearly passed over one eye. She held up two empty hands before her and took a couple steps closer. 

It was then that I realized she was a Precursor. They look human, but they don't move like one. With their long slow blinks and languid joints, their fluid motion is uncanny.
  
"I am simply looking to talk. I was hoping to secure employment on your crew."

"How do you know my name?" I asked. "Or my crew?"

"Ship registrations are not exactly private," she said, with a gesture to the Tail-End behind me.  Her hand moved like a boneless ballet dancer, with unsettling grace.

"And you are?" I asked. 
  
"You may call me Scarlet." 

"Well, 'Scarlet', why do you want to join my crew?"

She gave that slow Precursor blink. "The Flow led me to you. I seek revenge, and I believe you do too.  Somehow, our fates are linked, though I do not know how. I would be useful to you, as I have both combat training and technical skill."  She gestured to the hovering snooper.

I've heard of the Precursor Flow.  They claim they are able to intuitively sense the flow of time, of the delicate web of cause-and-effect.  They can't see the future, but they have odd intuitions that lead them to be at the right place at the right time. Some call it preternatural luck.  But what is lucky for the Precursor is not always lucky for those around them.

"And your sense of Flow… Does it tell you what will happen to me or my crew?"

She shook her head in a single uninterrupted movement. 

"Well, Scarlet, then it's your turn to forgive me. I hate to disappoint a lady, but I'm afraid I don't know you or the trouble you bring. Given my crew, I already have combat skill, and I have tech, and I have a particular job coming up where I can't have too many unknowns in flight.  Perhaps some other time?"

She accepted my refusal with the grace of a single accommodating gesture. "Perhaps we will find closure after your job then."

I watched her walk away. It was beautiful, but it also made my skin cold.

I realized then that I had decided to do the job. My crew was ready. This is why I had pulled us together. It's what we came out here into the Black to do. I went back in to tell Twitch to get us ready.

It was only later, as I was falling asleep, that I realized Scarlet's "closure" didn't necessarily mean employment.  A chance encounter, a little nudge, revenge exacted.

## Turn #9

### World

In the morning, I told the crew to get ready. Once we wrap this job up, we may need to get off planet.

We finished the ship repairs and ensured she's spaceworthy. 

I saw **Khanda** give the loaded dice a couple shakes, but then she headed into the _training_ sims instead.  **I** did the same.

**Twitch** _repaired_ a broken flak screen, and **Rosey** came back from a _trade_ run with a new frag vest. I donned them both. This is my revenge quest; my crew shouldn't need to take the bullets meant for me.

**Simon**, his head filled with new MBA strategies and aware that we might leave the planet soon, canceled a merchant link weapons deal to load up on double _trade_ goods for our next planetfall.  The kid's got a trading empire to build, I guess.

**Khanjar**, surly that we might leave this planet that he feels so comfortable on, went out drinking. He came back disheveled yet unsatisfied, so I suspect he tried to pick some fights. Luckily, he didn't find anyone stupid or mad enough to take on an armed K'Erin.

### Job

Twitch briefed us on the Black Stone operatives and their facility--about half a mile from that of the Blood Storms.  There should only be about 5 of the glorified _bounty hunters_ and merc wannabes, armed with scrap pistols and maybe a marksman's rifle. And we don't need to kill them: Just move through the place to _search_ for the key cards we need to get us into the Blood Storms' place. 
 
We don't know much more, though, so we'll have to go in cautiously. 

To keep it lowkey, we took the subway. We rode in separate cars with large duffles and overcoats to mask our gear. 

Their place was a large warehouse, dimly lit. We waited in the surrounding alleyways for dusk to settle and the foot traffic to thin.  Then Twitch popped the lock and we slipped in.
