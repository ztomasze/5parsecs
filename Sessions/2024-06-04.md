_Last session before Bill heads out on his road trip. Long one with a tough battle and traveling to a new world._ 

> On: [[../Planets/Caturix Prime|Caturix Prime]]

### Battle

The rattle gun loomed over us from its vantage point high on the ship's stern. The shimmer of an energy shield appeared around the gunner, and a barrage of heavy bullets rained down all around us.  We dove for cover as the Blood Storms on the ground also opened fire with their military rifles.

Khanjar was soon pinned down behind a crate ahead of us, as was Rosey off to the right.  Every time Khanjar popped his head up, bullets plinked off his armor and he was bodily shoved back behind cover.

Khanda dropped into a sniper pose and took aim at the rattle gunner above us. Two shots found their marks, but they were too slowed by the energy shield to be lethal. I tried to help. I'd like to say I distracted him just long enough for Rosey to finish the job.

Just in time too, as the Storms on the ground were quickly moving around both sides of their ship to flank us. They didn't count on Simon, though. He had found some magical position where he could sight down a narrow line and pick them off between the crates and parked vehicles.

Still, the Storms were moving in fast to surround the pinned Khanjar. I distracted a couple of them, and Khanda dropped one. The Storms kept Khanjar pinned down and put another dent into Rosey.

Khanjar chanced a quick counter-attack. Simon sent one of them Storms spinning, and Rosey made sure he stayed down.

But the Storms weren't breaking. Shots continued to force Khanjar's head down, and I heard another shot ricochet off of Rosey.  I was forced to duck myself. 

Then I saw what they were doing: Making an opening for their squat boss to move in on Khanjar. He missed, though, and Khanda blew the boss's left cheekbone apart for his trouble. Simon shot him in the armored ribs, but the bastard was tough. Khanjar surged up from behind the crate, using the boss for cover from the rest of the Storms.  Khanjar's blades flashed, but the boss parried half of the blows. Khanjar suddenly kneed him in the groin, though, and the boss toppled to the ground.

Taking advantage of the distraction, a Storm rushed us from the right, but Rosey raised her machine pistol and he went down hard.  

I heard a few plinks from behind me.  Glancing back, I saw Twitch laying down some cover fire.  Had he been doing that for the whole firefight?  It had been too hectic to track.

Turning back to the battle, I saw that it was over.  A bruised and angry Khanjar rushed the last Storm, shoving him hard and then bringing down his blades.

### Post-Battle

I turned to look for the stranger sitting among the crates. He was still there, sipping his lager. 

"Sorry for the intrusion," I said. He shrugged.

"What’s your name?" I asked.

"I’d rather not say," he said as he glanced around at the carnage. "Given the situation, I’d rather keep it anonymous and professional. I figure you’re here for something specific?"

"We’re looking for information," I said.

The man nodded.  "These young pups get caught up in the fanfare, and they forget this is a professional business.  The goal is to make money and to live long enough to spend it. Now, if they had been smart, we could’ve negotiated something before the bullets started flying. Now, we've got very little leverage left. What might you be offering for this information?"

I smile. "How about your life? Tell me what I want to know and you walk free of here, anonymous and professional." 

"With my kit?" he asked, gesturing at the gear stacked around him.

"Sure," I said. 

"Deal. What do you want to know?"

"Holrith's Crater, on Karnak 6."

He sat back in his chair and looked me in the eye for a moment, but then he told me what I wanted to know. It was an infamous job in Blood Storm history. A Storm chapter was hired by Unity military for it. 

"By a **Teal division**", the man said.  

I frowned. "Teal division? Never heard of it."

"None of us had, before or since. But one of Storms streamed a pict-feed of the orientation." He pulled out a data slate, searched, and showed me the stream. A group of Blood Storms sat in a small room on folding chairs, already kitted out for battle. Two men in black military fatigues stood before them.  Their uniforms indeed sported teal piping, which matched the color of their gloves and their frameless tinted eyeglasses.  Their mission briefing was more like a sermon: "We have come to harvest that which we have sown. You are to be the reapers. You shall cut down the stalks. We will be the threshers, for we will separate the wheat from the chaff. You will be directed, so that you do not damage the crop, for it is precious. Then we shall burn and salt the fields so that nothing may grow untended from our seed."

The man said, "The rest of the feed is choppy, but it shows part of the mission. It was a bad one. Brutal. They killed everyone."

I made myself watch the rest, looking for clues. "Maybe not everyone," I said.  "Look here."  In one scene, one of the teal division men stepped forward and waved the Storms off. He strode over to a pile of wooden pallets and pushed them aside, pulling someone small up from underneath them. The feed cut out before more detail could be seen.

"I'll keep this," I said. 

He shrugged.  "I'd say it's bad luck. It doesn't show the end of the mission. None of the chapter came back from that one."

"What? They were taking a little fire, but only from farmers and refiners. Was there an accident? I've seen the crater. It's been leveled to black glass."

He shrugged again. "Like I said, make the money and then live long enough to spend it."

While we'd been talking, the rest of the crew had stripped the ship and hanger of supplies _(7 + 1 = 8 credits_). They pulled a lot of damage gear from the bodies and the ship: a flak screen, upgrade kit, beam light, combat armor, and a working infantry laser.  Now they were loaded up and ready to go before any backup arrived.

I directed the man out the back, waited two breaths, and we hurried out the front.

We were on edge all the way back to the ship.  Khanda kept glancing around _(+1 reaction)_, Khanjar walked quickly _(+1 speed)_ with his hoverboard tucked under one arm, and Twitch kept his head down _(+1 luck)_.
  
Back at the ship, I checked the cortex. There was a military APB out about the Blood Storm hangar shootout.  Probably the Blood Storms had some friends in uniform, or maybe Unity just didn't care to let something like that slide.  Either way, with Unity grunts soon to be breathing down our necks (_rival_), it was clearly time to leave.  

Twenty minutes later, we were breaking atmo.

I checked in on Twitch.  He was sitting at his desk behind the pile of gear to be repaired. "You know, Captain, I think I'm tired of being the repair monkey. I've got aspirations. You need someone capable to help you _discover_ more about this Teal division, among other things."  He pulled his headphones on and turned back to his splinter web searches.

## Turn #12

### Travel

We needed somewhere to lie low for a while, somewhere we could make some money, and somewhere that neither the Blood Storms nor Unity would come looking for us.

Scanning through the region, [[../Planets/Goldeng 8|Goldeng 8]] sounded like it would fit the bill.  It's _foggy_, which reminded me of Carpathium 9. We've learned we don't like it too bright. But Goldeng 8 is also a bustling _free trade_ world.

When we came out of warp, Twitch flagged a wreck on the scanners, so we took a detour for a quick space walk salvage check.  We were able to recover a couple damaged gun sights. "Nice discovery," I gently ribbed Twitch as we dumped them into the overflowing repair crate in his berth.

As we came into orbit, the harbor master explained that we'd need a trade license to dock in one of the free trade ports. I was about to beam over the one credit fee, but Twitch rolled his eyes.  "No, it's the principle of the thing!" It took him about two minutes to whip up a fake license. "Oh wait, I'm sorry," I told the harbor master. "I had it misfiled. I _do_ have a license." Secretly, I held my breath for a moment, but I shouldn't have worried. It cleared, and we were directed to a berth.

### World

First order of business was to do some *trade*. **Simon** took **Khanjar** out to get the lay of the land, but they must have stuck to the back alleys that Khanjar likes because they only came back with a laser sight and some scrap parts.

**Twitch** sighed and *repaired* a suit of armor. **Rosey** fussed over the growing pile of broken gear in his berth and fixed a beam light to help him out.

**Khanda** and **I** headed out to look for our first job. While a local government office had something, it sounded dangerous. We also got word that Eldar Frankenmuir, a tech tycoon, was looking for someone for a quick job. 

Looking up this Eldar Frankenmuir on the cortex, it sounded like he had offices and vacation homes on a dozen different worlds. I figured this could be an advantageous relationship to cultivate, so Khanda and I headed over to see what he needed.

### Job

The meeting was short, held in the foyer of his beach home. We were not offered a drink or a seat. As we stood on the silky white carpet, we could look through the floor-to-ceiling windows to see the nearby channel bridge clouded in fog. 

Eldar's daughter, Abbi, was having a 15th birthday party at one of their off-world mansions. Eldar was running late on getting a gift to her.  He gestured and a servant brought in a sturdy carrier. "Miniature rhinopanther cub", Eldar explained. Not an appropriate gift for a teenager, I thought, but I held my tongue.

Eldar explained that the import/export paperwork was going to be a hassle and a delay, so he'd engaged a "courier" to speed along the process.  This courier was ready to leave from one of the "less regulated" spaceports within the hour.  However, this courier didn't do house calls, and that particular spaceport had a lot of riff-raff.  Rhinopanthers fetch a lot on the black market, and Eldar didn't want any more delays.

An easy job, so we took it.  Khanda hefted the carrier. Every now and then there was a mewling cry inside and then the carrier would rock in her hand as the cub pounce-charged into the opposite wall. Its little horn was already starting to poke holes through the siding.

I figured this job might be simple enough for the two of us to handle ourselves, but better safe than sorry. I pulled out my vox and contacted the crew, telling them to meet us at the spaceport with our gear.

When we arrived, I was glad I had. Khanjar handed me a duffle filled with my gear, and I quickly suited up. Behind him, I could see the smashed lights and graffiti of this particular wing of spaceport.  A real shithole, I'd say. 

We strolled down the taxiway corridor, counting down the hangar door number toward the one that Eldar had given us. Every now and then there was another _mrreow-thunk_ from the carrier, and Khanda would sigh. I took the carrier from her, and she was relieved to sling her auto-rifle case over her shoulder instead.

As we neared our destination, the inevitable scuffle and hoots of the local spaceport scum echoed down the taxiway toward us. These were some real derelict humans--probably junkies--but there were eight of them packing colony rifles and shotguns. And a big bare-chested bruiser put down the barbell of concrete blocks and rebar that he'd been curling and picked up a power claw. They drifted towards us, catcalling and winding their way through a few parked ships and vehicles, taking up a blockade position ahead of us behind a low wall assembled from pallets, barrels, and concrete traffic dividers.

Yeah, they were going to try to start something.
