_We set up quickly, then had dinner.  Discussed AI rules for a while, with a review of defensive AI afterward. Ended before 11p, but not by much._

### Battle

The tension broke when one of the men by the bar bolted toward an outdoor table and flipped it over for cover. The others scattered to better positions as my crew and I drew our guns. We dropped into defensive crouches near a smoking barrel in the traffic corridor. A few stray shots flew wide over our heads, and Khanjar rushed forward, blasting.

I followed close behind. The flipped table provided solid cover against Khanjar's opening blitz. Less so against the grenade I lobbed over it. There were some screams as a couple of the loungers were blown apart. One peeked his head up over the table. Whether he meant to snipe or plead, I don't know, because Simon put a bullet between his eyes with the auto rifle. I heard a clatter and the slap-slap of shoe leather as two loungers dropped their weapons and fled down the traffic corridor. 

We'd earned ourselves a moment of shock-and-awe with that opening, but already the spaceport scum were regrouping around us.  A couple mechanics, who had been tinkering on parked atmo cruisers across from the bar, fired up their ripper swords. 

I gave a nod to the Khans and they faded back into the vapor cloud, ready to sprint ahead to the hangar while the rest of us distracted the reinforcements.  We moved quickly to cover behind the plywood _TOLL_ barrier.  As I peeked over the top, I could see that the muscle-bound scum leader now had a stout sand runner lizard on a chain. Its nose was up, sniffing the air, and froth gathered around its muzzle. 

I ducked down again and turned to the others. I was about to whisper to fall back to the parked vehicles and speeder ships behind them when I realized that Rosey was watching something over my right shoulder. I spun to follow her gaze. I cursed as I saw Twitch disappear alone around the end of the barrier.

I heard a couple shouts, the revving of a ripper sword, and the loud crack of a scrap pistol. Then I saw Twitch reappear carrying an open crate filled with equipment. He was wide-eyed with adrenaline, and he gave me a big grin as he sprinted for cover around a parked speeder.  "Meetcha topside, Cap'n!" he yelled. He dropped to the ground and rolled under a partially open hangar door. He reached out and dragged the crate in after him, and then the hangar door slammed down.

Damn Twitch. Still, our job was supposed to be a distraction, and he'd just nailed that.  We fell back, laying down some suppressive fire to cover our retreat.  

The spaceport scum were hesitant to follow. Two long minutes later I heard some shouts and the roar of speeder jets.  A silver coupe with a smashed nose flew low over the barrier, its exhaust swirling the vapor cloud and blowing bright embers out of the smoking barbeque barrels in front of the bar. Flying down a taxi corridor is definitely a traffic violation. 

Princess landed just long enough for me to swap places with Khanjar. The coupe's leather interior still smelled new. The passenger floormat was streaked with white dust that added a sharp undertone, like a mix of spruce and cilantro. 

While the rest of the crew headed to the surface, Khanda taxied us to the next vehicle lift. 

### Post-Battle

We flew from there to the garage that Quenton Hyland had chosen.  After several hours of waiting, whiling away part of the time in a diner across the street, we made the final delivery. Quenton paid us handsomely at a total of 9 credits.

Back at the Tail-End, I caught up with Twitch. It was hard to reprimand him because the crate was a lucrative grab.  It held a cling fire pistol and three dazzle grenades, though they were all damaged.  There was also a compact "boombox" audio system and some other spare parts that Twitch said he could sell for at least 2 credits. Shiny.

That battle, with the explosion of grenades and the roar of ship engines overhead, brought back memories of combat I hadn't seen in years _(+Combat Skill)._ 

I think it left everyone else hopped up too, unwilling to sit still. Twitch gathered some of our extra funds, and he and Rosey stepped out to pick up some upgrades for her _(+Combat Skill, +Toughness)._ Twitch helped her install them deep into the night.  Although often insouciant, he seems to be learning fast with us _(+Savvy)_.

Khanjar wanted to celebrate by buying more weapons, of course.  Simon joined him. While Khanjar wandered the back alley gun bazaars, Simon enjoyed a nice meal _(+1 XP)_ in the restaurant I recommended last week.  They came back with two more handguns, and Simon was sporting a new blade on his hip.

They also had some guy named "Chez" in tow _(chance meeting)._ I put his name in quotes here because I'm pretty sure the ID he flashed was fake. He was eager to join our crew, and he hinted strongly that he could help us find both lost mercenaries and new jobs. The way his eyes kept drifting to the open hangar door told me he had some heat on him, heat we don't need. I told him our crew was full for now, but I'd be in touch if that should change.

As we stood up to see him out, Simon struggled to untangle his new blade from the table. As we turned in for the night, I told him that maybe it'd be better if I take the blade for our next job. 

## Turn #4

### World

The next day, everyone made themselves useful. **Khanda** and **Khanjar** hit the _training_ sims. **Rosey** showed me an extra bit of _trade_ she'd picked up with Twitch last night: a shock attachment that would give her machine pistol a less lethal setting. Good old Rosey. And **Twitch** had already _repaired_ the cling fire gun from the swiped crate.  "Here you go, Cap'n!" he said as he handed it over.

**Simon** then pulled me aside. While out on the _trade_ run with Khanjar last night, he had been able to pick up some rumors from "Chez" during their walk back to the Tail-End. "He recognized the Blood Storms that you're looking for. He said they'd been seen 'in stitches', whatever that means." _(rumor)_

### Job

After a late breakfast, I checked my cortex messages. 

Quenton had sent a thank you for the job. He added that he was starting a new business proposition, and he could use some reliable hands like us. He couldn't pay that well for regular work _(+1 credit)_, but the job was urgent _(this turn)_. Oh, and we needed to be _clean_ of any law enforcement entanglements. I used that as my out: We were currently lying low after the last couple jobs of breaking and entering, so we were perhaps not the clean hands he needed for the moment.

I had another message from Preston Reade at Solari. Still no work for me, but he was passing along a lead that they had declined: The local DIRM office was looking for contractors and were willing to take freelancers. Thanks Reade. Like I said, I wanted to lie low for a little bit. A job for a respectable federal Unity department in _sector government_ would fit the bill nicely.

DIRM is the **Department of Invasion Risk Management**. Every planet has one, overseen at the sector level. Their remit is early detection of possible invasion by alien threats. That might require detecting a K'Erin war fleet gathering at far solar orbit, verifying claims of Abductor probings, or exterminating a nest of spawning vent crawlers in the municipal sewer treatment plant. 
  
I headed over to the DIRM office. It was far less glamorous than the photoplays and conspiracy theories would have you believe. It took up half a floor of office space, filled with cubicles under a low white panel ceiling fitted with florescent lights.

After explaining to the receptionist why I was there, the local Field Director came out to meet me directly. **Paul Bosch** was below average height, bespectacled, with dark hair that had fully receded from the top of his head. He led me through the cubicles and computer stations to his office.

Once the door was closed, he offered me a seat in front of his desk.  From his chair on the other side, he laid out the details of the job.  DIRM had recently deployed a snooper satellite to low orbit to watch for incoming ships and foreign objects. Due to a malfunction, the satellite had come down in the remote region of **Apuseni**.  The capability to scan ships on a registered government channel meant the downed sensor module would have a high value on the black market  To prevent any embarrassment, he needed someone with a ship to fly out to the location post-haste (_this turn_) to pick up the sensor module.

While the pay was only standard contractor pay _(+1 credit)_, Bosch explained that he could supplement that with "accumulated discretionary spending".  In a weary tone, he explained, "Sector headquarters doesn't see it fit to provide us with such decadent luxuries as ships or launchers or even a sufficiently large regular staff.  Instead, we can put in a requisition order to the discretionary budget as needs arise. Well, we've had a few discretionary spending events recently, and we still have the gear in a storage room. It's already paid for and it's just taking up space, so I'd be willing to tap into that supply."  He paused and looked at me pensively.  "I need someone I can trust. If you're interested in the job, I'll need to process your intake forms and run some basic blood tests."

I said I was interested.  The forms were fairly standard. Blood sampling is not unheard of for sector jobs. They run your genetic signature through various systems of record.  While I watched Bosch do that at the console in the corner of his office, I saw him perform another test I hadn't seen before: He poured a few drops of my blood from the sample vial into a petri dish and then passed it over an open flame, staring at it intently. I don't know what he was expecting to see, but he visibly relaxed.  "All clear, Mr. Walker.  We can do business."

He gave me the coordinates to the satellite crash site.  He then led me back through the cubicles to the front desk.  I noticed this time that he didn't seem to make eye contact with anyone on his staff as we passed by.

As soon as I got back to the ship, we suited up and headed out.  The trip was smooth.  Apuseni was mountainous, so it took Khanda a few minutes to find a suitable landing zone.  We picked our way down to the wreckage, right where Bosch said it would be.

Just as we pulled the sensor module free, we heard the roar of engines overhead.  A beat-up old cruiser came arcing down into the valley, heading for a nearby landing zone.  "Looks like we've got some company," Khanjar said.  

He sprinted up a nearby rise to get eyes on the ship.  "Looks like cheap mercenaries, heavily augmented. Roid gangers. They're leaving their ship and heading this way. I count 5 of them, plus a gangly guy with two pistols."

"'Well, we've already got the sensor. We just need to get back to the ship _(move through)_ and get out of here. And they probably don't know exactly where we are, so we've got some element of _surprise_. Let's get out of here."  
  
I saw Twitch eyeing the rest of the satellite wreckage scattered along the ridge _(+1 shiny)_. "Sorry, Twitch," I said. "Not much time left for salvage."
