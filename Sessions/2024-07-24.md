### Battle

We used the few moments of warning that we had to rush toward the cave entrance. We could see six growling krorg smashing through the undergrowth toward us.

I coated the big one leading the pack with cling fire.  As it reared up roaring, two more rushed past it on either side. Simon put two shots into one of them and it keeled over. Khanda dropped the other. Jone put a heavy shot into the standing roaring leader, and it toppled backwards into the brush. Rosey shocked another one into twitching submission with her machine pistol.  And Khanjar ran past all of us to engage the last two of them.

As Rosey dropped another one, Khanjar was knocked heavily to the ground by a clawed blow. As the last krorg loomed up over the prone warrior, Jone put a shot into its head just over its right eye.

And that was that. Khanjar picked himself up with a scowl.

### Post-Battle

Rosey and Khanda dragged the leashed and mewling cub away from the scene while the rest of us did a quick search of the area.  It looked like the krorg pack had recently ambushed a speeder bike.  We were able to salvage some parts and a dirty but serviceable marksman's rifle. 

Reflecting back on the battle, Khanda had done well dropping one of the rushing krorg before it could flank us _(+1 reactions)._ Jone was just as deadly a shot as I remembered, but she was now also adapting to her heavier plasma rifle _(+1 CS)._  Khanjar is going to have to be a little faster _(+1 speed)_ if he wants to steal any kills from this crew.

We made the long flight back toward the city with the cub sedated and caged in the hold. We followed Eldar's directions to a rural spaceport docking bay, and someone was there to take custody. A few minutes later, my slate dinged with the arrival of 5 credits in my account.

Simon tried to talk us all into going out for a celebratory dinner at the hot-table restaurant again. I wasn't in a particularly social mood, so I told him to go on ahead with whatever crew he could get to go with him. 

I headed to my berth. I had it in mind to find us another job on the cortex. Three tumblers of amasec later, I found myself just staring off into space, thinking about the cave, the scattered dead krorg, and the little orphaned cub.

Jone knocked on my door. I opened it, guarded, as the sweet rich smell of her wafted over me.

"Halden, I put out some feelers, and I've _heard_ back. There's an organization here that may know more about your Teal Division _(rumor)_.  I should be able to set up a contact tomorrow or the next day." 

She glanced past me at the bottle and tumbler on my desk. She lay a hand softly on my chest. "Get some sleep, Captain. It could be a big day tomorrow."

Then she turned and passed down the dark hallway toward her berth. The rest of the crew must either have turned in or were still out at the restaurant. I closed my door, powered off my cortex terminal, and dropped onto my wrinkled bunk.

## Turn #15

### World

When I rose in the mid-morning, **Jone** was in a _training_ sim, while **Twitch** and **Rosey** were at the _repair_ bench hard at work on a jump belt and an upgrade kit. As I poured some breakfast into a bowl in the galley, the main hatch opened and the rest of the crew noisily came home.

**Simon** bore a box filled with broken snow globes, two half-drunk bottles of booze, an open case of cigars, and a unity sight. For some reason, **Khanda** and **Khanjar** were both dressed in matching but badly damaged combat armor. Khanjar had another bottle of booze in one hand. And behind them walked a bot.  Or rather, on closer inspection, one of the _Soulless_. They have a more elegant shape to them, and they move differently. More organically, somehow.  This one wasn't moving that smoothly at the moment because it was carrying a very large heavy object.  It looked like the main heating element and surface of a restaurant hot table.  It also carried an _infantry laser_ in a soft case on a strap over one shoulder.

Simon dropped his box on the galley table with a clatter. He swayed a little with a boozy grin on his face. "You, Sir Captain, have missed a most adventuresome evening! And a most excellent morning of _trade_ and merry _exploration_. I dare say that we may have to give a certain hot-table restaurant a wide berth for a while, but we have rescued this fine fellow from a life of servitude there. His name is…" 

Simon paused here for a moment, squinting at the Soulless carrying the dismantled hot table.

 "Ben-E", Simon finished.  "We have rescued him from menial servitude. He desires only the _freedom_ of the stars!" Here, Simon waved his hand across his view of the galley for emphasis. He put his other hand on the back of a chair next to him to steady himself. "He has lost the loving embrace of his kin. He is trained in the art of combat. He is familiar with all manner of _high technologies_. He has perhaps a small, one might say _petty_, incident on his _criminal_ record, but one I think we can overlook." 

The two K'Erin grinned at this, and Khanjar threw his arm, still holding the bottle of booze, around Ben-E's shoulders. Ben-E continued to hold the hot table. He stared blankly over it at me.

"As a partner of this business venture, I have offered Ben-E employment and a position on the crew," Simon explained. "I understand that you may veto this decision if you must, but I entreat you to give it your utmost consideration!" Simon paused here to place both hands on the table in front of him. He leaned over the table with his head down. He closed his eyes. 

"Meanwhile," Simon continued, "I must see to the slight spinning of the ship. A brief trip to the latrine may be in order." Simon stepped away from the table, put one supporting hand on the hallway wall, and hurried toward the toilet. I heard the door close and then, very faintly, the sound of retching.

I turned to Ben-E. "You can put that down, if you want. If you'll consent to an inspection by my, uh, Chief Engineer and an interview with me, I'd be willing to consider you for a crew position. Ben-E, is it?" I asked.

"Yes," Ben-E said flatly.

The two K'Erin continued to grin and elbow each other in their damaged combat armor.

"Twitch!" I called.

Twitch wasn't very happy about taking on the Soulless, but he said he couldn't pick up any signs that Ben-E was still communing with a collective. Rosey introduced herself and told me in private later that Ben-E seemed "nice". After a basic interview and quick combat sim test, he seemed well qualified for the work. When I asked for more details about the night before, he said, "I would prefer not to break the social rules of crew propriety. Could you not also ask other members of your crew for this same information?"  

I sighed. "I think you're going to get along just fine here, Ben-E. Welcome aboard."

### Job

Once that was settled, early afternoon was almost upon us. While a non-urgent corporate job was available for us on the cortex, **I** instead followed Jone downtown. We passed into the darker narrow streets of Old Town. Halfway down a puddle-lined alleyway, Jone led me into a small shop that simply said _Pawn_ on the front. A bunch of abandoned possessions filled a barred display window. 

A squat bot sat in a caged cubicle near the back of the crowded room. Jone said, "I'm looking for an antique copper watch. I heard you might have one." 

The bot looked at her for a moment and said, "If we have one, it won't have a chain on it."

"That's fine," Jone replied. "I've given up on chains recently." 

The bot glanced me up and down. He reached under the counter of his caged cubicle, and there was a faint buzz in the back of the shop. He nodded his head toward a rear door, partly obscured behind a shelf of dented musical instruments. "You can ask in the back."

We picked our way between the shelves, and Jone led us into a cramped breakroom. On the right side of the room was a study workbench, covered in dismantled gear. A short fit dark-skinned man stood behind the bench. He wore small wireframe glasses, his hair was graying and thinning in the front, and he kept his right hand down low and out of sight as he watched us enter. 

On the left side was a small table and three comfortable wicker chairs. A tea set and a plate with a half-eaten piece of toast stood on the table. A tough elegant older woman with gray-white hair sat in one of the chairs.  

"I'm Jone," said Jone as she closed the door behind us. The woman nodded over at the man. He reached his left hand across the table and the faint sound of blue static filled the room. The woman gestured to the two chairs in front of her.

As I sat down, I noticed that some of her fingers were missing. The pinky, middle finger, and thumb of her right hand had been replaced with black and gold metal prostheses. Curled in her lap, her left hand had similarly had her thumb and middle finger replaced. 

She noticed my gaze and said, "I didn't choose to have them removed."

"I…"

She cut me off. "I understand you're looking to locate Unity's Teal Division. We have a similar aim. We've done our research on you, and I believe we can work together. Your skill set would be valuable to us at the moment.  Just this morning, an incoming space vessel went down in the **Kardon** dunes. This has gone unreported, and there has not yet been an emergency team response, because this vessel does not officially exist. It has just come out of a particular red zone system. Information from the vessel's black box would be of assistance to both of us.  You can recover the information with this."

She pushed her foot under the tea table. A large metal scanner in a fitted leather carrying case slid out from under the tablecloth near my feet. _(delivery)_

"Time and discretion are of the essence, so we will provide _transport_. It can pick up your crew along the way. Kardon is known for its sand runners, and I believe it is breeding season. The extra bio signatures should help mask your presence from orbit while you extract the information.

"If you successfully retrieve this information, we will be able to tell you more about Teal Division. _(rumor)_ Our interests may continue to align _(busy)_, and we can cover your expenses during that time.

"Do you have any questions?"

I had a lot of questions, both for her and for myself, but none of them seemed essential right now. I trusted Jone, and this was a tangible lead after days of searching.  It was otherwise just another job.  I shook my head, stood up, and looped the scanner strap over my shoulder.  The path ahead seemed clearer than it had in weeks. _(quest!)_

"You can go out the back way. Take a left and you'll find a navy transport waiting for you at the corner."  She gestured again with one of her augmetic hands. I didn't see any scars on the remaining flesh, and I couldn't think of what sort of accident would do such selective damage.

The back door was thick metal. Jone pulled up the locking lever, and we slipped out into another alleyway. To our right, the alley entrance was choked with an overflowing dumpster. It started to rain as we turned left.
  
The transport was there, as the woman said it would be. A bot driver wove us smoothly through the streets of the city toward the spaceport as I called ahead to the team to get ready.

An hour later, we pulled off the highway onto a dirt road among the dunes.  The transport stopped.  Twitch was spotty on the comms, with static replacing about every third word. We scrambled out of the transport and headed up over the nearest dune.  We spread out into pairs, ready for anything.

As we crested the dune, we could see the _shiny_ wreckage of a small sleek space shuttle that wouldn't carry more than half-a-dozen passengers. Much of it was buried in sand or occluded by clumps of dune grass. I was starting to see how a crash like this could escape civilian notice.

We began working our way down the sand slope toward the wreckage. Twitch and static sounded in my ear. It took three tries before his warning made it through. By then, it wasn't relevant anymore. 

As if on some cue, dozens of hissing sand runners burst out of the sand around the wreckage and poured out of the dune face ahead of us. By the time I called out to the team, the swarm was already sprinting toward us.
