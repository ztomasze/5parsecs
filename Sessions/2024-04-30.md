_First session with Zach remote in Alaska. Took some time to figure out our camera setup, but we made that up with some efficient setup and a short/fast combat. Wrapped up by 10p PT.

### Battle

As the bullets flew, we dove behind a large tarp-covered transport and let the gang come to us. 

As they rounded the stacks of crates and storage tanks, I immolated the one bearing the ripper sword.  A bullet ricocheted off of Rosey, and then Khanjar was into the thick of it. A colony rifle shot dinged off his armor as he knocked one of gangers to the ground. Then Simon's beam light lit up the gangers and he took out two of them, including the stunned one. One of them turned and fled. There was a bang as a back door was thrown open and emergency lights came on overhead. Then Khanjar dashed around another stack of crates, and I heard a scream. As I followed him around, I found their brash woman leader laid out on the blood-splattered floor.

At that, only seconds after it began, the battle was over.

### Post-Battle

With the place secure, I set Rosey to patching up any of the gangers who were still breathing, including the leader. Khanda followed close behind. I saw her pat down one of the gangers, and then she slipped a canister of pills into her pocket _(2 doses of still)_.

Twitch broke into the caged office in one corner of the warehouse and rifled through their data files.  He found the data that I hoped would be there on the Blood Storms.  He also pulled some other info that he said would be valuable on the corporate market _(banked: corporate patron on this world_).  As he was wrapping up, I asked him to put in a call for emergency medical transport from An-R-key's system.

With everything we came for accomplished, we slipped out the front door. As we loaded back into the transport, I told the chauffeur, "I'm afraid an ambulance is on its way. You may want to call Judge Sandok to see if he wants to send a man down here."  The chauffeur nodded and pulled out a vox comm.

As we rode back to the Tail-End, I looked over my crew. Khanda seemed cooler under fire in this battle _(+1 CS)_, and Twitch was almost bored by the ease with which he hacked into An-R-key's data systems _(+1 Savvy)_.

Back at the meadow, everyone else boarded the Tail-End and flew back to Bacau.  I rode with the chauffeur back to Judge Sandok.

He was satisfied enough with our work to pay us another 3 credits.  I slid over the report Twitch had put together on the ganger bounties during the transport ride. The judge and I amiably haggled, and he paid me 3 more credits now for the greater bounties he'd claim on the gangers after doing the necessary paperwork.  He also slid a briefcase over to me.  "A little bonus gift for you," he said.  "From my supply."

It wasn't really a "pick of our choice" from the warehouse, but I didn't push it.  We'd done very well here for an easy job.

I flew back to Bacau on commercial air service. When I opened the briefcase for the crew, they groaned.  It was a grapple gun. I tossed it to Simon to sell next time he was out trading.

"Speaking of trading…" said Simon.  He showed me a brochure for a merchant link service that we could install on the Tail-End to increase our trade options. Simon said he'd found a smaller local-world company offering a special that included free installation, so we wouldn't have to pay more than the base module cost.

That turned out to be a bad idea. Once the install guy left, we realized he'd punched a hole through the hull shielding to get the link in, and the link module was held in place mostly with caulk and duct tape.  It was going to take us days to get this in working order again _(4 hull damage)_.  Simon tried to get in contact with the guy again, but the connection was refused: His vox ident number was no longer registered.  At least the merchant link module itself seems legit. My guess is that this guy just found it off the back of a truck or something and wanted to unload it quick.

After he left, Twitch wandered by. "Can't find my blast pistol," he said casually.  "But I could probably build a scanner to find it, if it's still on the ship." _(will find it next turn)_

## Turn #8

### World

As a reward for the job well done, we took a day of downtime.  **I** and **Khanjar** each hit the _training_ sims.  **Twitch** tinkered in his workshop on his new scanner project, and he also _repaired_ the hoverboard, which he handed off to Khanjar.  

As usual, **Simon** and **Rosey** continued to work on Simon's budding mercantile schemes.  He came back to the ship with a box of head massagers, which seemed pretty useless to me, regardless of which planet he tried to unload them on.  Rosey did much better, returning with an auto-rifle, which she gifted to Khanda. Simon also ordered some loaded dice through the new merchant link, just to try it out.  Given the visible wobble they had, they were pretty easy to detect as fake.

Still, **Khanda** scooped them up and headed out on her own to _explore_ town.  She came back four hours later, smelling of liquor and with a bruise on one cheekbone.  She slapped 2 metal credits onto the ship dining table before returning to her bunk.

I'm a little worried about her.  Why would a K'Erin princess forsake her family, her title, and her position to chase bounties out here on the fringe? I take it that traditional K'Erin culture doesn't agree with her, but I don't know if she's found a viable alternative path with us.  I know the bloodlust of personal battle is an important part of K'Erin culture--something that Khanjar revels in regularly--but that Khanda seems to keep at arm's length. How much effort does that take, to deny the acts of honor you've been indoctrinated in since childhood?

### Job

In the morning, I hopped on the cortex and messaged Bosch that we were available. Three hours later, I was in his office.

Bosch explained that he was tracking a cyber-synth syndicate.  The tech gang trafficked advanced and military grade cybernetic implants.  Based on recent posts in the darker recesses of the cortex, they had procured a novel design for sat-comm neural uplink.  However, Bosch suspected that the design is actually Converted tech.  He explained this is not unheard of: The Converted get some sap to implant a comm-link that plugs them into the nearest Converted collective.  Once connected, they begin to manufacture further implants, "infecting" those around them and soon producing a local hive of Converted.

Bosch slid a pict slate across his desk. “The implant will look like this. It has a distinctive form, in black metal, with these three gold diodes. It will be attached at the back left side of the skull. I hope you find only one of them. If you do visually confirm the presence of this xenotech, I need you to _eliminate_ it with extreme prejudice.”  He paused, then added, “There is no known procedure to remove this implant without significant and irreparable brain damage to the host.”

“This particular tech group scatters during the week, but they meet together on weekends beyond the city limits where they can get a clear sight of the sky. Here are the coordinates of that location.”

Two days later, we took off from the spaceport after dusk. We set down about 1 click from Bosch’s coordinates. We hopped a fence and cut through an arboretum towards a park in the Carpathium _gloom_. 

Twitch sent a snooper ahead and confirmed their positions: 5 tech gangers sporting telescopes, personal sensor arrays, reflector shields, and hand lasers, with one marksman rifle in the mix. Night vision imagery confirmed it: One and only one of them bore the black metal implant. 

We could easily slip in through the gloom and sparse tree cover, snipe him, and be out of here before his companions could react. Doubtful that Khanjar will be eager to hear that plan, though...
