### Ship's Log

#### Battle

+ A simple delivery job takes under the overpass by the skate park where a bunch of punk wanna start something.
+ We march up the center of the underpass, while Chirp scrambles up into a crane lift bucket. One panics.  R9 blows the Lt off the back of the half-pipe, but he pops back up in the center.
+ The punks rush us, guns blaring wildly. Chirp exterminates one with extreme prejudice, as does R9 on two of them.  Billie drops one and cleaves his face into a hit from another.  More panic off.
+ We follow up on the momentum and Capt. kills the Lt.
