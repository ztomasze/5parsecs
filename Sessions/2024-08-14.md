### Battle  

I shouted to my crew. Our weapons came up fast from under our long coats and out of our discreet shoulder carriers. We met the advancing Soulless line with an opening salvo to discourage them. Nine shots we fired, and every one of them missed.
  
Rosey broke to one side, dinging one of the bulkier Soulless, while Khanda and Jone put a few shots into the rest of the line with little effect.

The Soulless split into three groups.  The right group circled around a courtyard gazebo, while the center group came straight at us. One of their shots hit me hard in the shoulder and I stumbled back. That one left a bruise! Another shot hit me in the armor hard enough to drop me to a knee. Luckily, that meant a third didn't take my head off. I returned fire, bouncing a couple shots off of metallic Soulless skulls.

The left group bore down on Rosey, with one of their shots denting her with a heavy crunch. Khanjar moved in and the plaza erupted in flame. The nearby Soulless leveled their weapons at him and Khanjar dove into the shadows, covering his escape with another burst of flame.  This ignited a second Soulless while the first burning one fled through a storefront window.  As he did, he shrugged off some of his weaponry.  It's funny what you notice while high on combat adrenaline, but I made a note to grab that later.

The rest of us ducked behind shrubbery and concrete plant troughs, maintaining our covering fire. Simon took out one of the beefier ones. Rosey charged forward into the fray, shoulder checking the bruiser with the power claw and dropping the leader next to him with a burst from her machine pistol.  "No, Rosey!" I yelled as four of the Soulless turned toward her there in the open.  Their rifle shots cracked and whined off her armor, driving her back.  Yet, at the back of their line, another Soulless took the chance to slip off into an alleyway.

As Rosey miraculously regained her footing, she put another blast of sparking machine fire into the big bruiser. Khanda jumped a bush next to me and laid down supporting fire.  Then, out of the shadows sprinted a howling Khanjar. His glare sword ignited, there was a ripping sound like tearing through aluminum foil, and the bruiser dropped.  I moved up, switching to my cling fire gun, and doused their left flank. Soulless shields glowed blue in the inferno, deflecting the worst of it.  Shots from Simon and Jone behind us continued to ping off their plated bodies.  We finally had the Soulless on the back foot, but they weren't retreating.

I could see dark lubricant dripping down her right side, but Rosey swapped clips on her machine pistol and continued to fire. "Rosey, get down!" I called to her.  One of the Soulless dropped from her barrage. "Or nevermind", I muttered.  

Jone, Simon, and Khanda continued to snipe from behind, while Khanjar tussled with another Soulless. His glare sword sparked off its forearm with a blue flash of shield light. I tried another blast of cling fire, but it was more as an obscurement tactic at this point, given their shield settings.

As the flare of cling fire flames dissipated, our rear sniper line took their final shots and Khanjar finally stopped messing around.  He dropped the last Soulless in the center of the plaza with a roar of victory.

### Post-Battle

I saw a couple faces watching us from around alleyway corners, but we quickly and calmly scrounged what we could from the bodies.  We grabbed a working military rifle and a haz suit screen generator module.  I also picked up the dumped gear, though it was all scorched: a brutal melee weapon and three dazzle grenades.

But the greatest find was the power claw that Khanjar hacked free of the bulky bruiser Soulless that he had felled. I guess it makes sense not to install a gene-lock on your weapon when it is attached to you and you lack any biological matter to trigger it. 

We then scattered, leaving in pairs through different plaza exits to throw off any pursuit.  I took Rosey with me and headed after Mr. Panda Bear. 

I found him waiting, his shopping bag still in hand, under the awning of a closed shop across the street.  He saw us coming. He stepped further back into the deep recess of the doorway.  Rosey stopped a couple doors down, and I approached alone. _(+1 story point)_

"I saw you had a nice _panda bear_ there," I said, cleanly enunciating the passphrase. "I was wondering where you got it. I'd like to get one for my niece." 

He nodded to me. "I could write down the store address for you."  He set down his shopping bag.  I stood next to him. I slipped the scanner strap off my shoulder and placed the leather case down behind his bag. He pulled out a bit of paper and a pen.  He wrote on the paper and handed it to me.  It felt heavy, and I realized it was wrapped around a stack of plastic cards. Fanning them slightly, I saw it was our payment: 3 credits in anonymous tech store gift cards. An address was written on the paper wrapper. 

"Much obliged," I said.  He stooped down, gathered up his bag and the scanner, and headed up the street.  I went the other way, back towards Rosey.

We met up with the crew back at the ship.  Khanjar had already removed the attachment points from the power claw and was giving it a few deft practice swings _(+1 reactions)_.  Jone was cleaning her rifle _(+1 combat skill)_.  

I shared the address with the crew.  "The pawn shop org has given us a tip on where we might be able to find Teal Division. I looked this up on the cortex. It's a Unity Defense base. Seems like a good place to start."

We broke for dinner. When we came back to the galley table, both the address slip and Khanjar were gone.

A few hours later, Khanjar keyed in through the main door. He looked a little disheveled. He pulled the power claw off his hand with a satisfied grin.  He wiped a small streak of blood off of it before stowing it in the weapons cabinet. "Yeah, the teal stripes have been seen around on the bases here but not on that one." _(+rumor)_ "Also, I don't think any of those Unity grunts, whether here or from Caturix Prime, will come looking for us any time soon." _(-rival)_

My stomach sank. "Khanjar, we need to be discreet."

"Oh, I was discreet with my questions," he replied. "Just not with my motivation to answer them."  

I sighed. Any damage from his rash night out had already been done.  The best we could do now was pray that he hadn't tipped off the authorities that we were coming.

## Turn #17

### World

It seemed like our best bet was to just lie low for a bit and do some work before putting out our investigative feelers again.

As usual, **Jone** and **Ben-E** _trained_ while **Twitch** and **Rosey** _repaired_ some armor. **Simon** and **Khanda** headed out to trade, returning with spare parts, medical supplies, and extra fuel.  If we had to fight and flee in a hurry, we'd be ready.

### Job

**I** looked to get us a _job_. I even paid 1 credit to do it all official-like - just a typical freelancer team looking for honest work.  Sadly, none of that led anywhere, which is exactly why I don't like to pay for bounty subscription services normally.  It's a racket.
  
Instead, I got a cortex message from our old friend, Eldar Frankenmuir.  Just a friendly message asking us to acquire a specimen of local fauna called a "dragon". The offered fee was extreme, but there was no particular urgency.  That was a good one to keep in the bank.

The other cortex message I got was more urgent. Local law enforcement had tracked us down. I admit that my skin flushed cold for a second here, but then I had to laugh: They were looking to hire us!

Although Trellium XII had a strong Unity Defense presence, the Civilian Defense was left to handle crime and local issues.  They'd captured our recent fight at the mercantile plaza on pict-feeds.  The Soulless band were known mercenaries. Civilian Defense didn't really care to know what we'd done to piss them off because they had another mercenary band problem. Some rogue K'Erin warrior had set up a training facility in one of the abandoned science labs here on Tellium XII. He had recruited nearly a dozen Ferals now, and he was starting to lead them on raids to take out sensors around their camp.  The military had declined to do anything until about it because he had not yet actively stepped on their toes. Civilian Defense was still dragging its feet on this one, hesitant to send their own into battle with a dozen K'Erin-trained feral mercs. Then we happened along.  

I could see the logic to it. If we took the job, we'd either wipe out the mercs or at least weaken them enough for Civilian Defense to take over.  And, if we were indeed a risky band to have planet-side, maybe the mercs would soften us up in return.

Thankfully, the job wasn't a full assault on our part.  Instead, we'd simply be running *protection* for a mechanic sent out to repair one of the sensors.  But it was clear that we should expect some resistance.

Usually the best place to stay below the radar is to park right beneath the sensor.  Seems like taking this job and potentially earning some goodwill from the authorities could only do us some good.  I accepted.
