### Ship's Log

#### Battle

+ Picked up a tail from our last mission, coming for Jean in particular, so we decided to deal with them.  However, we didn't get a clean drop on them.
+ 0) Super seize... but failed all reaction, so normal seize after all.  Chrip heads up onto the roof of the ship while everyone else charges forward.
+ 1) Chirp takes one out. Jean shoots and Gizmo grenades, pinning them down.  R9 rockets forward. R9 mows down a couple and stuns another. A couple shots on Jean; other bullets fly over our head.  A secret agent kicks in the door and goes for Jean, but misses.  Billie rushes forward while Julie wounds one of the ship-snipers.  One panics away.
+ 2) Jean focuses on the secret agent, knocking him back. Billie leaps a fence and cleaves through a grunt before turning on the special agent, who knocks him back.  R9 mows down two more grunts. The special agent continues to focus on Jean, but misses.  Julie runs up and ends him. Gizmo heads back to the ship... and the rest of us soon follow.
