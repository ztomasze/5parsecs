_First session from Zach's new house in AK. Despite the extra week off, Zach was behind on the capt's log, so these (long) last two recaps came at once._

### Battle

Our initial salvo missed, but we kept up the suppressing fire as we moved to cover. A laser shot whined off of Rosey's armor.  Simon's auto rifle caught one of the grunts and two more shots from Khanda, down on one knee to leverage her new bipod, dropped him.

The inebriated grunts, surprised by the opposition, sent a hail of gunfire over our heads as they moved to cover of their own. The sight of Khanjar launching into the air on his hoverboard was too much for one of the grunts with a fury rifle, and he ducked back into the bar. Halfway down the alley, Khanjar remembered to draw his colony rifle.

As the other fury rifle wielder took aim, we all put our attention on him. Simon and Khanda's shots blew fragments out of the wall over his head, but I was able to clock him in the combat helm with a rifle shot and he dropped. 

Another shot pinged off of Rosey and she staggered for a moment.  Twitch popped up behind her and nailed a perfect head-shot… before winking out (_oops!_). Another upgrade, apparently, but the holographic Twitch didn't distract the grunts for long.

Khanjar was descending fast on his board, drawing his blade with a warcry.  But his hoverboard clipped the edge of a dumpster, and Khanjar lost his balance. His blade slipped from his hand as he tumbled from the board. 

In reply, Khanda's auto rifle sounded in rapid succession behind him.  Another grunt went down, and more of her shots found their marks. Rosey joined in. In her haste, Rosey blew the arm off of one of them.  I saw her flinch as shoulder bone fragments flashed white in the air.  

I ducked as a stray laser blast scorched the alley wall beside me.  When I looked up again, it was over.  Khanjar was crawling out of the dumpster, and the last grunt was fleeing into the bar at the end of the alley.  Of course that grunt was Private Selgaro.  So much for the bounty.

### Post-Battle

Given the several bursts of heavy gunfire, no one in the bars seemed eager to poke their heads out to investigate. We used the couple minutes of solitude that we had to strip the alley of any useful gear. All told, we pulled about 5 credits worth, though 2 of those were just _scrap_, like dented but reusable armor plates. One of the grunts also had a belt of three functional dazzle grenades.

“The rest of you head back to the ship with this,” I said. “I’ll stick around to ask some questions and try to misdirect any follow-up.” I winced a little at a laser burn on my shoulder, but it was only singed. A couple drinks would dull that pain. (_+Tough_) “Simon, nice shooting, but maybe talk to Khanda for some tips on sniping with an auto-rifle. (+_CS_). And Rosey, see what other upgrades Twitch might be able to do for you (+_Speed_).”

With the rest of the crew gone, I flipped up the collar of my longcoat, walked around the block, and stepped into a bar across the street.

Three shots of amasec indeed dulled the burn on my shoulder. I struck up a few conversations and steered them toward mercenary work, but I found no leads on the Blood Storms being in the area.  Soon, the bar was crowded. Law enforcement had come to clean up the alley. They'd closed the three bars there and started asking questions, so most of the patrons had drifted farther afield to get drunk tonight.

I was about to leave when I saw Wendy across the bar. I froze, and then I stood up on shaking legs.  She turned to glance at me as she spoke to the girl next to her, and I saw that it wasn't Wendy.  She was about 10 years younger than Wendy would be now, with a wider face, larger eyes. I gripped the bar and sat down again.  I ordered another drink, over ice. I nursed it as the ice melted, watching the girl that looked like Wendy for a while.

It's easy to remember the bright times with Wendy, but there had been some vicious fights too. In the end, she left me. I can't call our marriage a success.  Yet now, for her, I'm chasing a band of notorious mercenaries across the galaxy, dragging a crew who had nothing to do with any of it into danger with me. 

I thought about my crew.  It's odd to think how far we've come already.  Khanda, cut off from her people and her culture, but trying to find her way. Simon, breaking free of his mom's apron strings and starting his own trading concern. Twitch, well on his way to being a master hacker, so far from the hive slums where he started. Sweet Rosey, fretting about the rest of us, trying her best to shoot people "non-lethally".  And Khanjar… Well, it's good to know some things never change. Sometimes, they just learn to fly.

I smiled to myself, and I settled my tab. Life doesn't make much sense out here on the Fringe. Out here, love is fighting for the ones you're with. (_true love; +1 story point)_

## Turn #11

### World

I slept in an extra hour the next morning, and then **I** joined **Khanjar** for a round of _training_ in the gym, sweating out the last of the night's alcohol.

**Simon** and **Rosey** got an early start trading. They took a chance moving some unlicensed weapons and turned a decent profit.  They also picked up a used bipod and a camo cloak. That'd be valuable as Simon and Khanda continued to improve their sniper routine.

I checked in on **Twitch**. I found him _repairing_ a broken blade.  

"What happened there?" I asked. 

Twitch shrugged. "Broke somehow when we dumped last night's loot into the stash. About time you woke up. I know where the ship is docked. It's a simple private hangar, nothing too fancy on security. Ready when you are."  

"You could let me know these things a little sooner, Twitch. You don't have to wait until I happen to pop in."  I glanced down at the broken blade in his lap, and I had a sinking premonition.  "Hey, where's **Khanda**?"

Twitch shrugged.  "She _went out_ again last night after the fight. I don't think she's back."

I turned and ran back to the hold. The main door was just opening as I arrived. I sighed in relief as Khanda stepped in, but she was in a bad state.  She leaned heavily against the wall, and her right leg was soaked to the knee with blood from the wound in her side. 

"Rosey!" I shouted. "Medic!"

The two of them were in the cramped infirmary for a couple hours. I told Rosey to use whatever she needed from our med patch supplies.
  
Afterward, I poked my head in.  Khanda still lay on the surgery table-bed, but she turned her head toward me as I came in. I pulled a chair up next to her and sat down.

"So, is this going to be a regular thing?" I asked.

She looked at me seriously. "No, it's done. No more loaded dice, no more blade." 

Khanda looked away from me again, toward the ceiling.  "Humans don't understand what a blade means to a K'Erin. Our fight response is hard-wired into us. It is biological, beyond our control. We have woven it into our culture, but it is deeper than that. Undeniable. To walk unarmed with such an instinctual drive would be folly." 

"Last night, I did not surrender my blade, but I wagered it, on a toss of the dice. I think I was asking fate what I should do. I won the roll. I don't know what that means, but the three human men I was dicing with chose that moment to attack me."  

Khanda turned her head again and looked me in the eye.  "I killed all three of them while my blade lay there on the table. I scooped up my winnings _(1 credit)_, and I walked away.  That blade was no longer mine."

"I asked Rosey to give me this." She reached down and pulled aside the gown that covered her torso.  There, incorporating the fresh puncture scar of her wound, was a longer scar, burned like a brand, in the shape of a slender curving sword.  "My blade is now made of flesh and of _lombok_. I can never surrender it.  It can only be taken from me through death."

I nodded, because no words seemed appropriate.

"Well," I said, standing up. "If you're interested in facing death armed with only a blade of flesh and _lombok_, Twitch has found the Blood Storms' ship. I'm ready whenever you are."

### Job

We rented a surface transport this time. We loaded up our gear and drove through Solthurum to the hangar Twitch had found.  It was in an industrial area two clicks north of the bars. We parked a few minutes away and approached on foot. 

The hangar was freshly constructed, like most infrastructure on Caturix Prime. The sky doors were open, so the ship could leave in a hurry.

We moved in quickly to a side door. Exterior cameras panned to watch us, but Twitch popped the lock in seconds.  

We stepped inside as six men in Blood Storm jumpsuits moved to grab military rifles and a rattle gun.  They all wore distinctive cutlasses at their sides. It seems like I just can't get away from blades these days.

"I'm just looking for some information!" I called out. "No need to get jumpy."

The guy with the rattle gun pointed it in our direction and yelled, "Piss off, right now! You've got two seconds."

Then a thickset figure ran down the loading ramp from the ship, brandishing a hand cannon and a cutlass that arced with blue lightning.  "Kill 'em!" he yelled.
  
Yeah, diplomacy was a long shot. As we all raised our guns, I noticed an eighth figure sitting in a camp chair, securely nestled among a stand of heavily plated supply crates.  Although a heavy long gun lay across his lap, he raised only a can of lager as the bullets started to fly.  Now that was a _person of interest._
