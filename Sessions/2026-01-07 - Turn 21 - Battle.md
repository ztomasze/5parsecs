#### Battle

+ In a battlefield of craters, facing off against anarchists.  Missing Chirp and Julie!
+ 0) Normal seize. We spread out, with Billie cutting right while the rest of us cut left.
+ 1) They move up and spray shots at Julie, who is unscathed after 7 shots. Then Gizmo steps up to start the Battle of the Grenadiers vs their shell guns, taking first kill. Julie sprints up and drops one. R9 launches up onto a storage tank and drops another.  Billie pops some pills and sprints into the right group, dropping 2 of them.  Two next to him turn and run. 
+ 2) Billie, still boosted and raging, cuts through another and sprints from the dead right group toward the middle group, dropping a Sp. Lt and Lt. and dropped into a crater for cover.  Julie blasts the bruiser. R9 lays down cover fire on the left group, dropping 1. The Lt. rolls back to his feet.  Two grunts run up to Billie, one point blank that Billie luckily rolls away from. Gizmo disables one.
+ 3) R9 takes out the two on Billie. Another one shoots Billie.  Julie kills the Lt. and kills the grunt. Grunt stands up, and flees!  That ends it... but waiting for the rest of the party.
+ 4) Critters!  Vent crawlers crawl up out of a crater.  Chirp and Julie arrive!
+ 5) Jean dashes forward and stuns the middle one.  One of the crawlers sprints for Jean, and the other two at Billie, who ends them both.  Chirp moves up and execute the one in the crater next to Jean.  But it rolls back to its feet! 
+ 6) We all fire at the last vent crawler, ending it! (Julie snapshots it.)
