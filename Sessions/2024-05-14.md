_Last session from the Extended Stay on the Alaska side._

> On: [[../Planets/Carpathium 9|Carpathium 9]] 
### Battle

We were picking our way through the Black Stone training warehouse when the lights flipped on. The illegally bright overhead fluorescents momentarily blinded us. The Black Stones swept in on the far side of the warehouse, assuming a tactical formation.  Shots smashed through the air, just missing me and knocking Khanda back for a moment. 

We moved up quickly, converging on the boxing ring in the center of the warehouse.  We ducked down below the edge of the elevated mat as one of the Black Stones fell with a grunt to Simon's auto rifle.  Khanjar sounded his battle cry as he soared over the boxing ring on his hoverboard.  Three shots pinged off his armor, one of them leaving a trail of sparks.  I'm amazed he kept his feet.  Khanda dropped a marksman and his long rifle from the far side of the warehouse, so now we only faced scrap pistols.  It'd been so long, I'd forgotten what it's like to fight in the light.

With that, two of the remaining Black Stones turned and ran. The last one stood, jaw agape, as Khanjar floated down on him, blades drawn.  He managed a glancing blow off Khanjar's shoulder before he was eviscerated. 

And then it was over.

### Post Battle

"Quick, those two that got away will probably raise an alarm.  Let's get those key cards!"  

We tore into the lockers, pulled open drawers, and patted down clothing pockets. Soon, the place looked trashed with all the scattered belongings.  Along the way, we pocketed 6 credits worth of supplies and various scavenged tech. Simon and Rosey even pried out a water purifier system and were carrying it between them.  I raised an eyebrow. "High resale value,” Simon explained. "Also a potentially lucrative passive income stream.”

But we'd come up empty on any keycards. We all turned and looked at Twitch.

"No, Captain. It's here."  He reached into a zippered pouch at his hip and pulled out a device.  Given the exposed motherboard and looping wires, it was obviously homemade.  Twitched turned a couple knobs (-_story point_).  He then strode across the room and reached into a slim thigh pocket on one of the fallen Black Stones.  He held up a white key card, one corner smudged red with blood.

"Well done, Twitch. Now let's book it!  I have a feeling we just shamed these guys in front of the Blood Storms they were trying to impress. They may come gunning for us."  (_+rival_)

We killed the bright lights, readjusted our long coats, and slipped out into the street again.  We headed for the Blood Storm hideout.  

As we did, I quietly complimented Khanda on her shooting (_+1 CS_). Fine sniping like that will keep Khanjar--and the rest of us--alive, especially when there are opposing snipers or shell gunners on some future well-lit planet.

I also noticed that Twitch kept glancing at the blood spatter on Khanjar's chest and the side of his face. Twitch seemed a little, well, twitchier than normal.

As we neared the Blood Storm holdout, there was the roar of ship engines overhead.  A heavily plated mid-size transport arced up on a path to high orbit.  Twitch craned his neck as he read the ident numbers printed on its bow.  "Damn. That's one of theirs, Captain. The Blood Storms prize their secrecy. It looks like we spooked 'em."

We approached their facility anyway, but the keycodes had already been changed. Twitch couldn't pick up any life readings inside, though some remaining contingent may have been holed up in a shielded basement or panic room in there.  Either way, with our element of surprise lost, I didn't want to fight an unknown number of skilled and alerted mercenaries on their home turf.

We peeled off and headed back to the Tail-End. Twitch was glum. I followed him into his berth. He swept a pile of data slates off his desk and gestured at the displays he'd shown me before. "Useless! Now we're blind again… Unless we can follow that ship, and I track them before they go to ground again."

I nodded. "Get me their warp trajectory and a destination."  Twitch grinned, dropped into his chair, and turned to his displays.  I opened the ship intercom and started issuing orders.

Twenty five minutes later, we had launch clearance and the engines were rumbling beneath us.  Simon and Khanjar were stowing three colony rifles they'd hastily acquired. As the ship thundered its way out of atmo, Twitch walked into the hold. "[[../Planets/Caturix Prime|Caturix Prime]]," he said.

## Turn #10

### Travel

We were hailed almost as soon as we dropped out of warp.  **Caturix Prime** lay below us, rusty land masses surrounding scattered cerulean seas. An entire navy battle fleet sprawled at grav anchor in high orbit.  A petty officer demanded our ident details over the vox. 

Minutes later, a navy shuttle docked with us, and we were boarded for inspection. 

The Caturix system has only a single habitable planet in close orbit and three icy gas giants beyond. Caturix Prime was originally populated by a race of large bugs called arcnids. These were almost exterminated by a K’Erin war fleet about a century ago. However, before the K’Erin could fully colonize the planet, their settlers were infected by the Converted. When the K’Erin nation abandoned the colony to their fate, Unity swept in and firebombed the planet, eradicating bugs, K’Erin, and Converted alike. The navy is still here, mopping up in the planet hinterlands and ensuring that neither the K’Erin nor Converted try to recolonize. Because of the local planetside threats, weapons are strictly licensed and tracked. 

The boarding party consisted of an ensign and four privates wearing black military uniforms sporting the yellow piping of the Logistics Division. They scanned all of our possessions and registered our weapons.  We affirmed that we were not looking to buy or trade weapons, so there was no associated fee, but the serial number of each was noted carefully.

Throughout the inspection, one of the privates kept glowering at the two Khans. He had a scattering of shrapnel facial scars and a limp. I suspected that he'd seen more action than is traditional for the yellow Logistics division.  He had likely started his career sporting the red of Combat division. 

Finally, he stepped forward, pointing down at Khanjar's boots. "Those will need to be registered." One of the other privates shrugged and started scrolling his data slate. "Steel-toed boots…" 

"No," said Pvt. Scarface. "They've been augmented with blades there at the tip. That's a different category." He stepped up to Khanjar, standing face-to-face about four inches away from him. "You're going to need to pay 2 credits to register a new weapons category for your dirty _kreek_ weapon, or else we're going to confiscate them."

Upon hearing the racial slur, the other private glanced up from his data slate.  His eyes widened a little. The tension in the room was palpable. Khanjar stood relaxed, yet completely still, staring back at Pvt. Scarface.  Khanjar's waiting stillness was more unsettling than his usual battle bluster.  It somehow promised deadly consequence, like a loaded pistol, safety off, lying on a kitchen countertop. 

Pvt. Dataslate swallowed and said, "Look, Oswald, I think we can just… I mean, they're just combat boots." 

Pvt. Oswald Scarface didn't break eye contact with Khanjar. "Two tours on the Red clearing this planet of kreek scum, and now they just sail in, free and clear, like it doesn't even matter…" 

I glanced across the hold to see the frowning ensign heading our way from a cluster of open crates.  

But Khanda was faster. She stepped forward and laid a hand on Khanjar's shoulder.  She spoke softly in K'Erin. Khanjar's jaw tightened, but he stepped back, bent over, and unlaced the boots. He stood up again, holding the boots close to his chest.  He then formally handed them to Khanda, as if they were a folded flag at a graveside ceremony.  I couldn't read Khanjar's expression as Khanda accepted them. She has some sway over him that I don't fully understand, perhaps something to do with her being a princess.

As the ensign reached our group, Khanda held the boots out to Pvt Scarface. "I offer these as a _gundar_ gift to you, in recognition of the damage done to your _lombok_ by my people." 

Pvt. Scarface narrowed his eyes. With a glance at the ensign, he pulled the boots from Khanda's hands. "Okay, fine. Confiscation it is then."  As he turned, I caught the faintest smirk on Khanjar's lips.

The ensign furrowed her brow, aware that she'd just missed something.  To be honest, I felt the same. "I think we're done here, Mr. Walker. You can head planetside now. Do you have a spaceport destination?"

"**Solthurum**!" called Twitch from the corner of the hold.  He stood there with opaque display goggles over his eyes, his fingers twitching through control gestures in front of the scanner on his chest.

"Solthurum," I confirmed to the ensign.  She took a note on her data slate, and the inspection team headed for the airlock.

As the thump of the opening outer doors echoed faintly through the hull, Khanda was already halfway across the hold, headed for her berth. Khanjar stood next to me, watching her go.

"What just happened?" I asked.  "What's a _gundar_ gift?"

Khanjar looked at me for a moment.  "For K'Erin, _lombok_ is your… motive force. Your will, your intention.  Like spirit, but not quite. 

“Sometimes, another person gains control of your _lombok_. For example, a K'Erin may feel such strong love for another that their _lombok_ is no longer their own.  Or a _lombok_ is taken by force, such as when a master takes a slave. 

“In these cases, the usurper may offer a _gundar_ gift, in recognition of the control exerted. _Gundar_ gifts are exchanged in the life-bond ceremony--like human marriage. Sometimes both K'Erin give a _gundar_ gift when they are bonded, and sometimes…"  Khanjar glanced away at the door that had just closed behind Khanda. "Sometimes only one would be given."

"To accept the _gundar_ gift is to admit that your _lombok_ is not your own." Khanjar grinned. 

"So…", I said as I mentally replayed the scene I'd just witnessed.

"So Khanda asked the little man, 'Are you my bitch? Do I have your _lombok_?'  And the little man said, 'Yes!'"  Khanjar laughed out loud.  "That is why she is Princess. It was worth the boots. I never liked them anyway." 

### World

As soon as we touched down at the Solthurum space port, **Twitch** got to work tracking down the Blood Storm ship.  While he was waiting for his cortex queries to run, he also _repaired_ a frak grenade.

As typical with Unity, they'd flown in colonists and established population centers even though the navy fleet still orbited above. **Simon** was eager to get out into that population with **Rosey** to do some _trading_.  Sadly, their box of Carpathium 9 snow globes didn't survive the gentle caresses of a military inspection team, but they unloaded some other stuff.  Simon used the ship's merchant link to pick up more local goods to restock. They also hit the bazaars, returning with a bipod and a tracker sight. 

**Khanjar** hit the treadmill for some _training_ (_+1 Speed_). 

Once he was done, I poked my head in.  I found **Khanda** beating the shit out of the heavy combat bag. K'Erin don't sweat. Instead, their fine dorsal ridges swell and their back and core flushes green, radiating heat. Khanda was breathing hard, flushed a deep emerald.

I watched her from the door. She stopped murdering the bag and steadied it with both hands. Without turning, she said, "Do you know what it means for a K'Erin to surrender a blade to an enemy?"

"Shame," I said.

Khanda leaned her forehead against the bag. "Worse."

"Neither you nor Khanjar have surrendered a blade. Not even a toe blade."

She gave the bag a savage kick.  "I'm going out," she said.

"It may not be wise to _explore_ this planet on your own," I said.  "Given the local sentiments." 

She turned on me, eyes narrowed.  "Is that an order?"

"Just a suggestion," I said. 

"Then I'm going out."  She swept past me. A few minutes later, she was dressed.  She paused in the mess to roll her loaded dice, but she left them on the table.

**I** waited up for her, putting out some feelers on the cortex for any local _jobs_, but I came up empty.

Khanda returned late. She'd obviously been _noticed_, and maybe even seen a little action out there, but she wasn't hurt. We each turned in for the night without speaking.

### Job

In the morning, Twitch had at least an area for us: The ship had gone to a private hangar in the northern section of the city.  He was still narrowing in on the details.

The whole crew seemed edgy, off-kilter due to warp-lag. I suggested we head out to the area and do some old-fashioned investigating: Ask around, shake the tree, and see what we could find (_opportunity job_).

Twitch stayed behind while the rest of us took public surface transport to the area.  We soon found ourselves in a shadowed alley at mid-day, about to (_search_) poke our heads into the three bars that lined it. 
  
At the end of the alley, four Unity soldiers lounged at a couple battered tables, knocking back a few brunch lagers. As we approached the first bar door, one of them yelled down the alley at us. "Hey! No kreeks allowed off-leash around here!" They pushed back their chairs and stood up.  They grabbed up infantry lasers that stood leaning against the table and approached. They wore no insignia on their uniforms, so they were either off-duty or AWOL. Behind them, three more grunts leaned their heads out of the bar.  Two of them cradled heavy fury rifles.

I sighed and glanced back down the alley toward the main road.  Just then, a wide red beam emitted from Rosey's chest and scanned the face of one of the approaching grunts.  He stopped in surprise. Rosey said, "Private Selgaro, wanted in the [[../Planets/Taldari|Taldari]] system, _bounty_ issued." Twitch had apparently been installing some upgrades.

Private Selgaro recovered quickly. "Why you…" he muttered as he raised his laser.  

We all went for our guns.
