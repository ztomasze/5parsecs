### Ship's Log

#### Battle

+ At the country club, the local militia storms in on us from the parking lot.  We head toward the glass-enclosed structure in the center.
+ 0) Super seize the initiative: We all sprint forward and Gizmo lobs a smoke grenade to grant us some cover.
+ 1) While generally we're caught off guard, they all sprint forward. A few pot-shots come our way, but the smoke cloud does its work.  We start flanking around the smoke, laying down some return fire. R9 takes first kill, dropping two on the right flank.
+ 2) R9 leaps into the river and continues to spray bullets, dropping two snipers and wounding another. Billie goes in for a kill. Jean and Julie put more into the gunslinger and his companions.  Three shots, all on Billie, all deflected off his armor. Chirp reaches the top of the building  and cleanly executes one of the snipers off a car.  One panics away as our VIP companion Georgie enters the cabana.
+ 3) R9 executes the last one.
