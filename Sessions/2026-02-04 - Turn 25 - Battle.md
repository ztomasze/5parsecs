### Ship's Log

#### Battle

+ We run back to where we parked the ship near the docks.
+ 0) R9 lays down covering fire while Gizmo runs for the ship and the rest of the crew moves up to cover.
+ 1) Billie runs into their left flank while Jean takes the right, shots plinking off their armor.  A spray of shots on Billie, two miss the ship, and the right flank closes on Jean, bullets deflecting off her armor in a shower of sparks.  R9 and Julie move up on the center group.  Chirp clambers on top of the ship and blows the head off one of the rattle gun specialists.
+ 2) Chirp drops the another specialist next to Billie. Jean blasts the right flank as they close in on her. Shots pour onto Billie, who luckily dives out of the way. R9 and Jean take a hail of fire. Billie hops up, cleaves through one, and runs to the center group.  Gizmo lobs a dazzle grenade after him. R9 drops a couple. 
+ 3) Chirp shoots a rattle gunner in the throat and he drops. Jean drops back, blasting into the cluster with her shotgun.  R9 closes and drops the last rattle gunner. A shot pings off the ship with a whine. A couple run in and tussle with R9. Billy runs in.  Three more appear behind the ship!
+ 4) Chirp wounds the incoming rattle gunner. Jean falls back while blasting at the right flank closing in behind her. Billie continues to mop up the frayed left and middle group, but gets knocked back, only saved a shout from Chirp. Julie's shots deflect off of armor.  R9 drops one closing on him. Billie takes some shots, a stim-pack keeping him up. Julie pushes one off of herself.  A couple more shove R9 around. Chirp takes a shot, another stim-pack keeping him up, another spray of fire tears into the ship. Gizmo tosses a grenade.  (Desperate plan: Jean pauses and Chirp goes twice.)
+ 5) Chirp executes the rattle gunner that's pummeling the ship. Julie and Billie work on the tattered remains of the left flank. R9 drops another off of him with all the barrels of his rattle gun. Gizmo misses a shot. The enemy misses a lot, including on Chirp. Chirp shoots back and drops him. 
+ 6) Julie and Billie continue on the left flank, with Jean's help. Gizmo fall back to cover and distracts the most capable one left. Chirp executes the last one on the ship.  A few shots and a tussle from one on R9. 
+ 7) Jean's shot bounces off of armor, and Julie shoots wildly, dropping one. Chirp drops some *still* and execute the secret agent that's been badgering R9. Jean gets knocked down hard, luckily staying conscious. One of them, that's been following Jean around, shoots at the ship. R9 softens one up, Gizmo misses it, and Billie runs into the finish it. Only the secret agent is left.  (Possible reinforcements coming in.)
+ 8) R9, Jean, and Chirp start softening up the secret agent. Julie ends him!  Billie clears the incoming reinforcements. 

We run for the ship!
