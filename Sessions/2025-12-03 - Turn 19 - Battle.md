### Ship's Log

#### Battle

+ In the spacious lobby of a boil lab research facility, we escort the lawyer of a watchdog org to read a subpoena aloud.  However, they call out their security team!
+ 0) We rush through the metal detector into the lobby.
+ 1) An opening volley on forces Billie's head down, and then the security bot peppers the area around Jean. She pops a booster pill, sprints forwards, and blasts the bot.  Gizmo trots forward to the fountain and lobs a stun grenade.  The bot sparks and smokes and deactivates!  Julie takes one out, as does R9 on the other side of the room.
+ 2) Jean takes out a couple, R9 drops a couple more, and Chirp ends it.
