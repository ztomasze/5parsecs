### Captain's Log

A few days of downtime was more than enough. Billie and Jean have started playing punchball in the hallways when they’re not training, and Gizmo has been playing the same TechnoThump track on repeat for days in his workshop. I swear the da-dum-dum of the baseline can be faintly heard echoing back out of the ship’s walls even after he’s turned it off for the night. I convinced R9 to take Gizmo out of the ship for a bit to go on a trading run - Gizmo brought back some useless mechanical trinket, but R9 found him a damaged motion tracker that should keep him busy with repairing for a little while. I’ve been searching for jobs for the crew, but haven’t found anything worth our time yet. Corporate worlds like this one tend to be short on mercenary work.

Chirp seems to be back to his usual self, and this morning he left early for his glidearound, as he calls it. He came back buzzing, and called me over immediately. He’d managed to trace the anonymous poster of the Leo Kowalski bounty back to the net-handle SpyderNova. As he was investigating, SpyderNova had posted another anonymous bounty, this time for a Hulker Gang boss.
