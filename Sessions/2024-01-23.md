### Two Graves

They say that before you walk the path of revenge, first dig two graves. Well, I've dug those graves, in Holrith's Crater, on [[../Planets/Karnak 6|Karnak 6]]. And this is a log of that journey. If I should fall, perhaps someone else can see it through.
 
My name today is **Cpt. Halden Walker**.  I've had other names.  I was born to a military family; joined the Academy; graduated to SpecOps. I've done some dark things for Unity.

But I found a light to guide me through the dark.  Let's say her name was **Wendy**.  I loved her more than anything, but Wendy wasn't cut out for Neverland. I spent too long away, on deep cover jobs. We had a little boy that I only saw on leave.  Three years later, Wendy called it quits.  Said she needed someone stable, someone who'd be there for Peter.  She found someone else that fit the bill, a prometheon prospector named **Jeb**.  Wendy and I conceived a daughter the night before she married him.  They boarded a colony ship that week for Karnak 6.

Four years later, an alert came up on the cortex, triggered by a feed on Holrith's Crater.  There'd been a terrible accident.  

I went out there.  The whole crater was smoking black glass.  All of the settlements were scorched. There was a survivor, though. A half-burned teenager.  He described trained men in fatigues bearing the logo of the Blood Storm mercenaries. And there were others with them, pairs of men dressed in black with blue markings.

I found Jeb's place.  I buried Jeb and Wendy there, though I needed a gene scanner to ID the remains.  I combed through every other body there, swift or otherwise.  I didn't find the kids.

Funny thing about having a light in the dark.  Even if it's distant, it gives you a bearing.  When it goes out, you're alone, adrift in the black.  SpecOps is a young man's game.  I put in for early retirement.

### A Crew

I drifted for a while. Then, a couple months ago, on [[../Planets/Sheun Prime|Sheun Prime]], I started putting together a crew.  

I'm a firm believer in having a dependable bot to watch your back. **Rosey** practically has a maternal instinct, encased in enough metal to withstand a blaster hit or two.

Next, I looked for muscle, and there's no finer muscle than K'Erin. I found **Khanda**, a K'Erin princess, slipped loose of her family and working as a bounty hunter. She'd happened across a clan member, **Khanjar**, far from their home world. He seems devoted to her, like a younger brother.  They had an atmo gunship, with Khanda focused on the bounties and Khanjar shooting whatever other trouble popped up along the way. Khanda had some sour run-ins with the Blood Storm mercs herself, and she was willing to sign on.

The last crew member was **Twitch**. He was my diversity hire: a tough ganger kid with an eye to tech.  At the time, he wasn't much more than a script kiddie, but I thought he had potential.  He'd already made it from the substacks of his industrial homeworld to a decent living in Sheun Prime, which requires some savvy.  I needed someone to handle "security", and he didn't come with the heat or baggage of some of the other applicants I'd considered.

I'd done solo ops for so long, it was strange to have others under my command again.  We started working what jobs we could find to afford a ship, but Sheun Prime is a nice place.  Freelancer jobs were rare, and few patrons were willing to take a chance on an unknown crew. Within weeks, we were at the tail-end of our luck. The Khans' gunship took a nasty hit on a job gone sour, and we were quickly sliding into debt.

Then we met **Simon Tao**. The kid's an heir to **Gloria Tao**, a Sheun mogul. He wants to prove himself, to head off into the Fringe to fame and fortune.  Says his dad built their fortune by doing the same in lithium mines.  

I've seen something like this before. Super rich parents, fueled by rejuvenat, rule their personal empires for a century or more. They regale their kids with stories of their own hard work, but the kids never have the space to try the same, especially not standing in that long shadow.  So, either of their own volition or their parents', they head out for "a season on the Fringe", like a year abroad.

Simon pitched me on the idea: My crew, his funds. He thinks he can make it in etherium mining, which I doubt.  Etherium certainly pays, but, unlike prometheon, it takes serious bank to tap your first mine.  I told him I could at least help him build his bankroll through freelancer jobs while we scout these supposed deposits he's tracking. We shook on it.

I feel like a big game hunter on this one. Simon points the direction and might open doors to the upper crust for us. I make the call on how we run the jobs and hold veto power there.

Then Simon's mom paid me a visit. She would provide us a used ship--a _former diplomatic shuttle_. She said she could call in a favor for us if we got stuck (_one patron, banked_), but she'd only do it once. Finally, with a sharp edge to her voice, she told me to keep her son safe. I do believe there will be hell to pay if I fail in that task. She turned and left me feeling like a first-tour private, dismissed.  If Gloria Tao is already hitting the rejuvenat, she's doing it with style. I could watch her walk away all day.
  
We named the ship _**Tail-End**._  We were suddenly debt-free, we had transit off-world, and we had Simon to open the doors ahead. Our luck was turning around.

## Turn #1

### Travel

We made landfall on [[../Planets/Carpathium 9|Carpathium 9]], docking in **Bacau**.  In my opinion, the planet is a shithole. It's far from its sun, occluded by regular eclipses from the thick asteroid belt that crowds the Carpathium star (_Gloom, 9"_).  With so much debris in the system, Unity fleet patrols are rare and other visitors can sneak in close before scanners can pick them out (_invasion risk +1)._  But, unlike Sheun Prime, you don't need a license to run freelance here. It's a good place to get our feet under us and to get practice as a crew.  Also, I have a contact out here who let me know that Blood Storm mercs had been spotted in the system.
### World

Once we docked, the crew headed out to stretch their legs. **Rosey**'s protective instinct kicked in and she came back loaded with _stim packs and med-patches_. She likes to play it cool, though, and referred to us all as "fragile meatbags". **Twitch** returned with a crateful of choice _ship repair parts_. We're docked at a busy space hangar with a lot of dark corners. I didn't ask where he got them.

When the K'Erins came back, **Khanda** confirmed the rumor: The Blood Storms were here in Bacau, though the sighting was not recent (_rumor_).  **Khanjar** spent the day in a back alley neuro-gym, laying down new neural pathways (_+2 XP_) for the karambit fighting style favored by local gangers here.

Meanwhile, **Simon** and **I** headed out to find a job.  I met with my contact, Preston Reade at **Solari Logistics** (_patron, private organization_). He had a good job for us, dangerous but high pay.  But damned if Simon didn't find a better one--even higher pay for a simple delivery run.  I told Reade I'd be in touch.
### Job

Simon's job was for a wealthy individual named **Alek Golinko**. Mr. Golinko would be having a rooftop party soon and required additional "refreshments".  I've heard of such parties held by the super-rich. While the wage-slaves choke out another 12-hour shift in the industrial smog of the stack below, the rich breathe clean air and dine on exotic delicacies like tiger meat or jams made from berries so endangered that they need to be hand-fertilized in climate-controlled greenhouses.   

Still, the pay was good and the job simple.  We had only to head out to the substack burbs to pick up a package. Given that it was an urban job with low likelihood of violence (_small encounter_), Twitch would sit this one out and provide comms support from the _Tailend_.  (Unbeknownst to him, I'd pocketed the ignition crystals. I was curious if he'd try swiping the ship. Like I said, he's got savvy and I'm still learning how far I can trust this crew.)

We descended to Bacau's substack levels and then rode the rail out to a burb named Magura. The pickup went smoothly: Two soft cases of silver canisters from a bald well-muscled man in a white lab coat.  I'm pretty sure they were cans of high-grade "whiff".  It's a local inhalant that produces short-lived euphoria accompanied by bright visual and olfactory hallucinations. On a gloom planet that stinks of industrial exhaust and mining dust, a shot of bright beauty can be addictive. 

The return trip would be trickier.  Whiff is a banned substance that would trip the rail station scanners, so we'd be making the return trip along the surface. We'd have to wind our way through power stations, smelters, and the pylons supporting the shipping docks above. The part that worried me the most was Cutthroats, a neighborhood regularly torn apart by ganger violence.  Based on Twitch's cortex research, I planned to cut straight through GDX (_Gear Death Xperience_) territory. My hope was we'd slip right behind all the GDXers who were busy patrolling their border.

It didn't turn out that way. As we picked our way around a pack of smashed vehicles abandoned in the parking lot of a fenced power station, I could see fresh HFB (_Happy Fun Bunch_) graffiti sprayed over the local GDX markings. Twitch then sounded over the vox-pieces in our ears. Our small snooper drone above us was picking up movement just ahead: Five gangers still on the prowl. Facial recognition said the muscle-bound leader with the metal skull-plate and the gene-uplift tusks was Razr Dawg, the HFB leader violent enough to have a bounty on his head. The rest of the gangers carried shotguns.

"And I think they have a gimp," Twitch added.  He patched the drone's pict feed through to my wrist slate.  Indeed, the feed showed a skinny body wrapped head to toe in a shiny black body glove, except for a right arm fully encased in metal and glowing with the blue arc-light of a projected power claw.  "Oh, I do believe the Khans will want to fight that Claw."  

I heard an odd pop-pop-pop in the background of Twitch's vox feed. It took me a moment to realize the little bastard was making popcorn.

I gestured the others toward me.  I was about to whisper about the gang of augmented thugs just ahead of us when the roid-gangers saved me the trouble.  They began whooping and howling.  

"I think they've detected you," said Twitch over the vox.  I swore to myself that he'd be out here with us on the next mission… but first the rest of us needed to survive this one.  

This wasn't a fight we needed.  We just had to _move through_ with the two packages to get them to Mr. Golinko in time for his party.  Maybe the rest of us could draw off the gangers.
