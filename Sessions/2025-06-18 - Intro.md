### Captain's Log

Hello everyone and welcome to my vlog! I’m Juliette Andromeda Tao, but you can call me **Julie** - all my friends do. I’m out at the end of the galaxy looking for adventure. And you’re invited to come along!

I arrived on [[Chaebol 6]] yesterday, hitching a ride on a corporate yacht returning from shareholder meetings in the inner systems. One of dad’s partners made the connection - I think their daughters go to the same dance class. Mr. Yoshimo was kind enough, but he spent the entire flight reading documents. Boring!

First things first, I need a ship and a crew. After a few dreadful interviews, I met **Chirp**. His ship is Birkenstock-class long-range scout vessel - good fuel economy and a beauty to look at. He’s an experienced captain and pilot, but after years of running corporate routes, he’s looking for something new. He seems weirdly comfortable in zero-g, even for a Swift; I think he might have grown up on a long-range vessel. I used the last of dad’s gap year funds to pay off the remaining debt on Chirp’s ship contract. We’re officially partners, and free to fly wherever we want!

Most of Chirp’s crew transferred, but two of them decided to stay on - Gizmo and R9. **Gizmo** is the ship’s mechanic, and Chirp assures me he’s one of the best. He loves lists and spreadsheets, and gets really excited talking about fusion drives. **R9** is the ship’s Bot and does a lot of the cargo movement, but he can also fix just about any part of the ship. He and Gizmo talk in their own language of whirs and beeps. I’m not sure if it’s an actual Engineer language, or just something they made up out of boredom on long-haul flights.

I knew we were going to need some more muscle to do mercenary jobs, so I headed to the local Hunter bar, the Second Chance. I needed skilled fighters, sure, but I also wanted a crew with aura for the vids. I found the perfect pair almost immediately. **Billie** was cleaning up on the arm wrestling tables. He beat a scarred K’Erin with his left hand while making lewd gestures with his right - not the smartest move. Just as the K’Erin started reaching for a knife, a tall woman deftly distracted Billie with a beer and simultaneously steered a server with a tray of drinks into the path of the K’Erin. By the time the server had passed, Billie was lost in the crowd, and the K’Erin stormed off to take out his anger on someone else. **Jean** looked like she’d won every genetic lottery that ever existed, twice. She was a little unaccustomed to the way passersby would double-take when they saw her, so I don’t think she was born with it. Genetic uplifts are expensive, but whomever she hired was top rate.

I joined the two of them in their booth and gave them the pitch. They might have taken just about any paying job, but when I told them we were going to be famous bounty hunters, their eyes lit up. They didn’t offer much about their past or how they met, and I didn’t ask. There’ll be plenty of time for that in future vlogs!
