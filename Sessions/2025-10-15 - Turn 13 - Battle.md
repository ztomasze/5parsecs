### Ship's Log

#### Battle

+ Entering a deserted market area late at night when we are suddenly ambushed by mercs
+ Brutal open salvo drops R9 and Chirp, and Gizmo only survives with a stim-pack.
+ Jean breaks to the right and stuns, while Julie and Billie cut to the left and drop one of the mercs.  Gizmo wounds another with a grenade, who panics away.
+ Jean drops a couple more, and Julie drops one.  Then, through a spray of gunfire, Billie rushes in to cleave through the Lieutenant into a grunt. Gizmo distracts. One panics.
+ Jean softens one up, and Gizmo sways from his wound, and tosses a stun grenade.
+ Billie sprints across the field... while Jean softens up the last one.  Billie fails to drop it while Julie sprays bullets around it.  
+ Jean cleans up.
+ Jean and Billie made all the kills.
