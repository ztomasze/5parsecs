#### Battle

+ Outdoor engagement in a scrap yard to take out a new model Mk II bot.
+ 0) We seize initiative and sprint for cover.
+ 1) Chirp dashes for high ground while the black ops move up through the cover of the underbrush. We move up too. 
+ 2) Two of them break cover and come for Jean, and the rest move up. Billie rushes in and cleaves through one and is blocked by armor or the other.  Gizmo tosses a stun grenade over a rock pile and softens up the trio including the Mk II.  R9 rockets up onto the rocks and sprays them with rattle fire. Chirp drops an op behind them.  Jean and Julie work on the right flank. 
+ 3) Gizmo takes out the trio, Chirp wounds a one off of Billie while Billie 5 shots and cling fire whine off of his armor.  Jean dives for cover from a shot, and drops the last one bearing down on her. Billie melees and R9 blasts a bunch. A desparate plan, and more reinforcements arrive near Jean.
+ 4) Jean blasts into the reinforcements while Billie kills an op behind a tree.  Julie and R9 pour fire into the reinforcements. Gizmo disables. A couple ops come in on Billie and he luckily dodges a melee hit. One jumps on Jean, who kills him but takes a wound herself. R9 goes to help Billie as part of the desperate plan. 
+ 5) R9 and Gizmo try to kill the closest op to Billie.  Billie goes into finish him off, and cleaves into the one behind him and kills him too!  Chirp stuns one. Julie drops one off of Jean, which ends it.
