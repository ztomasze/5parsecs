### Ship's Log

#### Battle

+ Brood is pouring to the hanger, chewing progressive holes through the walls.  Two ships are already destroyed as we sprint for our ship. But the ship is rebooting, so we're going to have to wait for the landing ramp to come down.
+ 0) Opening 15 shots on seize the initiative, all missed!
+ 1) Jean stuns one out for first kill. We run for the ship, guns blazing on those ahead of us. 
+ 2) Billie and Chirp head for the ship while R9 lays down covering fire. Jean and Julie cover our rear.
+ 3) All going slow, as we catch our breath. Jean slaughters one that leaps on her, then she and Jean clean up the pack behind it while R9 puts hurt on another.
+ 4) Nine more burst in through the walls! Another leaps on Jean, who slices through it. Chirp makes it to the ship and executes an incoming pack leader while Gizmo lobs a grenade into the pack. R9, Julie, and Jean continue to purge the incoming pack while Billie dashes back to throw himself into the remnants, cutting down two.  Three of them get back up. 
+ 5) Another big pack pours in through the back. R9 cleans up two of the ones who got up, while Chirp scrambles up onto the ship and wings one of the incoming ones from the side.  Several of them reach the ship and start clawing at it.  Bille falls back and shotguns one of them.  Jean slaughters the two under the starboard wing while Julies defends the port wing.  Gizmo steps forward to lob another grenade.
+ 6) Two more side packs and one rolls back to its feet under the ship. Julie executes it while Chirp clears off one coming through the back wall.  The swarm now pours in from all sides, so we focus on those clawing at the ship.  Gizmo rolls another grenade under the port wing, and R9 clears off the rest on the ship. (Possible reinforcements)
+ 7) The ramp is down... just as the back wall of hanger caves in as a massive swarm pours through!  R9 and Jean toss dazzle grenades to clear off the starboard side while Julie moves to clear off the port side.  The swarm hits us!  Billie gets mobbed; he cuts through them all, although he takes a few smacks.  R9 gets mauled in a combat, although he manages to kill one. Julie kills one that comes for her.  Chirp, Gizmo, and Julie all toss dazzle grenades. (Renewed efforts)
+ 8) Chirp throws an extra dazzle grenade to clear off the starboard side, while Jean clears off the port side. The last of the swarm charges Billie, and Billie slaughters all of them. R9 drops some an incoming batch while Billie dashes to clear off the last one on the starboard side, but luckily avoids a wound. Gizmo disables the last one on the port side.  The swarm starts to break and flee.
+ 9) Chirp, Julie, and Jean try to keep them off the ship. Jean gets mobbed; Captain kills one on her; Billie gets mobbed and wounded. One on Jean renews its attack and dies. R9 adds some stuns. Gizmo throws a dud grenade. Billie kills one and cleaves into another.
+ 10) Chirp executes a pack leader. Jean kills one, and Billie drops the last one!  But it stands back up.
+ 11) Julie kills it. We flee, with no hull damage!
