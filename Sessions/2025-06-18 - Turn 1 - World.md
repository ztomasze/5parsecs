### Captain's Log

So when I paid off Chirp’s contract, I forgot to save some credits for living expenses for the crew - whoops! Dad wired me a little extra cash to get started. But we’re going to pay for all our own expenses from now on, I promise.

While Chirp and I went off to look for our first job, the rest of the crew kept busy. Billie and Jean hit the training sims - it’s been a little while since they’ve seen real action, and they wanted to shake off the rust. Gizmo and R9 went out to the market to do some trading, attached at the hip as usual. R9 brought back several bottles of Bombay Sapphire - I’m not sure if he understands the difference between food and drink for organic creatures. We’ll keep them in the hold until we can figure out what to do with them. Gizmo on the other hand managed to score some aftermarket cyber-configurable nano sludge. I think the vendor thought it had expired, but when Gizmo started humming to it, it sprouted a tiny forest of ripples, matching his changes in pitch exactly. He and R9 managed to apply it to the rattle gun they’ve been working on together. It now makes a strange sort of electronic purring sound when they rotate the barrels. They claim it’ll shoot good, and I for one don’t want to be on the other end of that thing.

For our first job, we chose a delivery contract for Chirp's old employer. They have a research facility in a rough part of town (less environmental regulations down there) and need a sensitive package delivered, but a local gang has taken over the area. Should be an easy drop-off, and the gang will probably be scared off when they see us coming.

We handed out weapons before picking up the package, just in case things got rough. I chose the hunting rifle - it’s not as nice as the target rifles we have back home, but I should still be able to take out any threats before they become a problem. Chirp picked the infantry laser, which is good because it’s effective at any range. He never can make up his mind where he wants to stand, and half the time you turn around and he’s already dashed off somewhere else. We gave Billie the biggest pistol we had, though I’m still not sure if he’ll shoot with it or use it as a club. I think he needs to get his eyes checked. He’s intimidating as hell, so I don’t know if his enemies will stick around to find out. Jean silently took a military rifle and a pistol. I’m pretty sure she could kill a Krorg with a paperclip, and she didn’t seem to mind taking the lightest weapons. R9 was the only one strong enough to carry the rattle gun, though his balance routines haven’t adjusted to the weight properly. He still wobbles a bit whenever he changes direction. I don’t think Gizmo has ever aimed a gun before, so we gave him the autorifle in the hope that it would help. I honestly wanted him to stay with the ship, but he argued that 6 was greater than 5, and I wasn’t sure how to rebut that. So he’s coming too.
