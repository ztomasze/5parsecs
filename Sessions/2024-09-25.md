*Set up an inverse board for the tunnel system, where tiles define the ground and the normal mat is impassable. Talked about 2014 D&D's VSM rules for spellcasting before getting started.*

### Battle

Khanjar stepped off the rim of the access port and dropped down the dark shaft on his hoverboard.  The rest of us made do with the metal ladder rings that descended down the side of the shaft. Even through the hazmat suit, I could taste the tang of the gas in here.

When we reached the bottom, tunnels branched off in several directions. They were barely tall enough to stand up in. Here and there were openings to even smaller vents and ducts--too small for us, but just big enough for vent crawlers. We turned in the direction of the Unity base.

Khanjar glanced down at the motion detector display on his wrist slate.  He grinned, turned slightly to the right, and dove into a cloud of venting gas.  Though the haze, I saw the flare of his hand flamer.  My wrist slate was beeping too.  Seconds later, I heard an agonized groan and the sound of an armored body hitting the metal tunnel floor.  Khanjar's hand flamer came spinning across the floor from out of the gas cloud.

"Oh, shit!" I said in warning to the crew. I sprinted after Khanjar. As soon as I spotted his prone body, I lobbed a grenade farther into the fog.  Behind me, I heard Khanda and Rosey tossing grenades down another tunnel.  And over the persistent beeping of my wrist slate, I could hear the claws and hiss-clicking of vent crawlers swarming in the darkness beyond.

Suddenly their glistening carapaces appeared on the walls ahead of me in the weak beam of my head lamp. I hosed them down with cling fire. Gunfire sounded from behind me.  Out of the flames before me, a vent crawler leapt onto my shoulder, clawing at my armor and tearing at my haz suit. A shot from behind me blew the crawler off of me. "Right behind you," Simon assured me.

"They're swarming, Captain!" Rosey's voice echoed from farther behind us.  "We have to go. I'll run interference."

"Rosey? Rosey!" called Khanda. "Captain, Rosey's gone! I'm running for the exit!" More gunshots underscored her plan in the dark. Glancing down to the glow of my wrist slate, I could see the gathering red dots, most of them behind us.  But the terrain scanner had finished its work. It looked like both of the tunnels we'd forked into eventually converged at an exit.

I reached down and hauled Khanjar up over my shoulder.  He groaned and stirred.  "Run, Simon!" I called, and we sprinted into the dark as the wave of hiss-clicking calls grew louder behind us.

### Post-Battle

Rosey already had the exit door open when we got there, and Khanda pulled it closed behind us.  We were in a large airlock. As soon as the door closed, I could hear pumps quietly humming in the walls. The haze in the room cleared. 

I set Khanjar down with his back to the wall, and he gradually caught his breath. He's been eating well and taking care of himself lately, so, with clean air to breathe again and a few field dressings on his scratches, he soon pushed himself back to his feet.  

Rosey had found a body on the way here.  We pulled 6 credits of gear and a haz suit off of him, though it hadn't done him much good.  Simon commented on the design and then tightened the straps on his own *(+1 savvy)*.

Just as we prepared to open the far door of the airlock, I got a cortex message ping from Twitch. Surprised that the signal had even made it to us down here, I pulled out my slate and played the pict-message.

It showed Twitch, his face close to the camera. He looked wary, weary, sweaty, and pale.  The camera moved back as he adjusted his position. I could see he was propped up in the med bay. Fresh bandages covered his shoulder. He held Khanda's lost blast pistol in his other hand.

"Captain, we were just charged 5 credits in taxes and spaceport fees. I'd have been able to do something about that if I didn't have to deal with this loud-mouthed homicidal piece of shit!" The camera swerved dizzyingly to reveal Ben-E.  The Soulless was strapped to a metal table, struggling against his bonds. There were fresh dents in his armored shell and smears of lubricant on the table under him.  Ben-E stopped struggling and looked at the camera, but he said nothing.

Twitch turned the camera back to himself. "I'm going to take a little nap now," he said as his eyelids drooped.  I could now see the medical auto-bot unit behind him and the tubes running to the bandages on his shoulder. "If anything should happen to me before you get back, I want you to vent this piece of shit into space. You hear me!?"  I wasn't sure if that last was directed at me, since Twitch looked up to yell it in Ben-E's direction. 

Twitch leaned back, rested the hand clutching the pistol on his chest, and thumbed off the pict-recorder.  The message ended.

I sighed. I put the slate back into my thigh pocket and hefted my cling fire gun once more.  I'd have to deal with that later.  For now, we had a Unity base to breach.

## Turn 19b

I nodded to Rosey, and she shoved open the door ahead of us.
