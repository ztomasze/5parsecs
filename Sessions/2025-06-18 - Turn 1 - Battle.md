### Captain's Log

When we arrived at the block of the dropoff address, the street was even more of a mess than I expected. Several of the garbage cans were in flames, and one of the fire hydrants had been knocked open and was spraying a stream of water across the road. The likely culprits were at the other end of the block, playing a rough game of street hoops. The teams they’d chosen were “muscles vs no-muscles”, and the muscles side seemed to be enjoying the new recruits around with their power claws while their leader watched from the sidelines. Some hazing ritual I imagine. We must have tripped a proximity sensor, since as soon as we came around the corner the leader started barking orders and they all grabbed weapons and charged at us.

Chirp swung around to the right flank and took a shot with his infantry laser, dropping one of the gangers instantly. I took a shot with my rifle, but only landed a glancing hit - I’m still not used to shooting without a proper scope. The ganger’s return shot blew right through the top of the new captain’s hat I’d bought for myself. An inch lower, and I’d have been toast. Jean climbed on top of the car next to me, using the roof to steady her shots. R9 moved out in front, his camo cloak shifting to match the colors of the cars behind him. I thought all Bots came with lethality controls, but if R9 had them at some point, he certainly didn’t anymore. He emotionlessly dropped ganger after ganger with focused bursts from the rattle gun.

Billie, who’d been sprinting down the sidewalk on the other side of the parked cars, came around a corner face-to-face with one of the gun-toting gangers. Billie pulled the rifle off his back and swung it hard into the ganger’s chest with a crack. Sad that his first swing hadn’t taken the ganger down, he grunted “Your turn.” Confused and a little dazed from the blow, the ganger shot Billie in the chest point-blank. I learned after the fact that it had deflected off one of his shock-absorbing nipple rings, but all the ganger heard from Billie was “My turn.” Not wanting any more of this strange encounter, he turned and fled.

The power claw wielders (team muscles) had almost closed the gap when we finished dispatching their gun-wielding new recruits. With Chirp shooting at them from above, Jean and I sniping, and R9 blasting away from the center of the street, the battle was over a few seconds later. I don’t think Gizmo contributed at all, but he managed not to get himself killed or shoot any of us in the process, which I’m counting as a win. We weren’t able to scavenge much from the battlefield, but with the gang dispatched, we were able to deliver the package and I heard the sweet chime of credits being deposited into my account from my hand terminal. Not a bad first mission together! The whole team managed to escape unscathed, but there were some close calls, and we need to invest in some better armor and screens if we’re going to keep doing this.

We picked up a blade for Billie on our way back to the ship. If he’s going to use whatever he’s carrying to hit people, it might as well be sharp. We also met a trader who was willing to swap a stim pack for one of our colony rifles - another good find.

When we got back, we discovered a birthday package for Gizmo. Something must have gone wrong with the address scanner - the card inside was addressed to Guillermo - but the two doses of booster pills could come in handy in future fights. That’s probably not the “good time” the gifter had in mind.
