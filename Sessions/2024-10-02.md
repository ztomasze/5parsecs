### Battle

I wasn't ready for the view on the far side of the airlock door. 

Wisps of toxic haze drifted through the dim air between clusters of glowing vats and holding cells. Each vat held a different alien monstrosity suspended in thick fluid. Tubes and electrodes snaked up through the ooze to the top of each vat. Humanoids moved weakly on steel beds in the holding cells, maybe lifting a head or a hand at our entrance. They were also connected to tubes and wires, and they each bore scars, bandages, or fresh surgical wounds.

Across the room, past a massive central power hub and control panel, several war bots activated along the far wall. Red glows lit up their face plates. 

A heavily augmented human in a black surgical suit and rebreather face mask turned to us, dropping his hand to the gun at his hip. I didn't see any teal piping on his shoulders, so maybe he was a contractor or mad scientist freelancer. I also couldn't see his mouth move behind the rebreather, but he must have issued a command. The war bots stepped in our direction, raising laser guns and a couple hyperblaster rifles.

Time to do what we came here for.

Glowing shots streaked through the hazy gloom, sparking and flashing into the steel wall over our heads. Rosey and Khanjar ducked, sprinting for the cover of the central power hub. The rest of us dove for local cover among the vats and a few storage crates.  Khanda laid her auto-rifle across one of the crates, and one of hyperblaster-wielding bots exploded.

Khanjar popped up to our left and lit up a couple more with his hand flamer.  He must have burnt through some sort of sealant, because the haze around them changed color as a fizzing bubbling sounded from inside one of the bots.  It spasmed and fell. 

I followed suit, felling another one and blowing the head off a third. Two more explosions sounded as Jone and Rosey took their shots.  Two flaming bots crashed into each other as gun fire wildly fanned across the room.  A vat exploded in a viscous shower of fluid and glass. A shot glanced off my armored thigh.  Simon sighted between the bots; the contractor feel to the grille floor. 

Up ahead, through the growing smoke, I saw Khanjar's power claw ignite and then arc down into the last bot.  At the same time, the bot jerked back from Rosey and Khanda's shots. Khanjar whirled back to glare at Khanda. "My kill!", he glowered. Khanda shrugged with a smile. Rosey politely raise a hand to offer a third possibility.

### Post Battle

Before that particular debate could continue, I set Rosey to pulling data from the central hub while the rest of quickly swept the room. 

It looked like they were still setting up shop here. We were able to pull about 8 credits of valuable parts from the fallen war bots and a couple of the storage crates. One crate held parts that would even service for starship duct work. Jone and Simon stood over an open crate, pulling out a cling fire gun, a shell gun, a colony rifle, and a suppression maul. 

I was just starting to inspect to the experimental subjects in the vats and holding cells when Rosey called out a warning. She pointed to an array of pict-screens on the central power hub. Three of the four showed SpecOps teams in black uniforms and teal piping running through hallways in our direction. I looked at Rosey. 

She said, "I have completed the data pull, Captain."

"Then its time to run. Now!" I yelled to the crew. Everyone grabbed what was close to them and we sprinted for the door we came in through. 

I took one last glance back at the demolished lab. One of the bandaged human reached out a hand in my direction as the back door split open and black uniforms started pouring into the room. I shoved the airlock door closed. I felt a shiver run through it as it sucked tight into place, forming an airtight seal between us.

I'll spare you the details of our retreat through the vent crawler ducks.  Suffice to say, Simon still has a couple scars *(+1 toughness)*, and Jone no longer eats crustaceans *(+1 luck)*.
