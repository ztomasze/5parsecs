_Started the first round before dinner, and we wrapped up around 9pm._

### Battle

We broke cover from the ship and split into two groups.  Rosie, Twitch, and Khanda cut to the right around a couple fountain sculptures, while Khanjar, Simon, and I ducked into an overgrown patch of vineyard.  

Rosey stuck her head up and drew a shot from the militiamen.  Then suddenly everyone was shooting. 

Weaving through the vines, I lit up two of the militiamen with my cling-fire gun.  In the burning haze, I saw the silhouette of Khanjar sprint between them. His two blades flickered faster than my eye could follow,  and a third militiaman was separated from an arm, a leg, and his head before his body could hit the ground.

Behind me, Simon peered out of the vines.  I heard his auto-rifle rattle, and another militiaman fell with a grunt.

Then I heard a loud ricochet of metal off of metal and Khanda yelled, "Rosey!"  Rosey stuttered a reply, but she was still up.  They closed in on the militiamen firing at them, and Twitch dropped their lieutenant.  

Then Simon and I broke cover from the vines in a flanking maneuver and ended it.

### Post-Battle

We killed the cameras and quickly swept the battlefield.  I found a duffle bag filled with canisters and soft plastic-wrapped bricks.  It looks like the militiamen had discovered Quentin's crew's stash. I tossed it onto the ship _(5 credits)_.  Khanda pulled something from one of the bodies _(personal trinket)_, and I grabbed a data slate off of another _(loot: data files)_.  I'd later learn from it that they'd contracted training a month ago from, interestingly enough, the Blood Storm mercs!  They had a contact number too. _(+2 rumors)_

After sweeping through the house and ensuring the estate was both secure and clean of obvious incriminating evidence, I called in the local law enforcement. 

We were there for several hours.  They found that one of the militiamen was still conscious and rushed him off to the hospital.  More of the militia crew showed up, returning to the villa from a snack run with a fresh supply of cheesy poofs and beer.  There were some very unkind words exchanged, and the cops had to hold them back before violence erupted again _(+rival)_.

This battle had been brutal, bringing back old memories for Khanda and I _(+CS each)_. But even more depressing was all the paperwork and ensuring inquest (_Capt sits out of next mission; +1 story point)_. There were also some hefty fines to pay _(-2 credits; taxes)_.

## Turn #6

### World

Thanks to the public inquest, the "Lordly Lads" militiamen knew who we were and where our ship was docked.  The death threats started coming in, and a few of the glowering Lads started cruising around the spaceport.  One of the cortex messages they sent was explicitly graphic in the detailed violence they promised to inflict on each of us.

**I** spent most of my time at the inquest, but, with a couple well-placed credits and **Twitch**'s help on the cortex, I _tracked_ down the Lordly Lads' home base.  I passed that info along to Khanda, accompanied by my cling fire gun.  Threaten me and my crew, and we'll threaten you right back.

I also contacted Quenton and got paid a handsome 7 credits for the job.  

### Job

Getting ready for the next job--which would be of more of a personal nature--**Rosey** and **Simon** headed out for some _trade_.  They weren't able to scrounge up much of use, though--just an extra handgun and some spare parts for repairs.

As I left the ship the next morning for the inquest in my one and only scratchy brown blazer, the rest of the crew took to the skies in the Tail-End. The Lordly Lads have been gunning for us hard, and so perhaps best we lay that to rest before they compromise our business interests here.  I think us coming to them directly might catch them _off guard_ and help them see that this was just business.  If they don't take no for an answer, though, then there will be a _showdown_.
