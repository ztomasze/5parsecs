### Captain's Log

We stepped into the first construction hanger; so far so good. No one had noticed us leave the tour, and across the end of the massive hanger we could see two partially-open doors leading into the engine test space where our goal waited. No sooner had we crossed the threshold than the alarms started blaring.

I saw armored guards springing into action in the second floor security office overlooking the hangar. I made the split-second decision. We’d already come this far, and we were so close to our goal. The main group would distract the guards while Chirp and Billie ran by, snapped a few pictures, and then fled back to the hoverspeeder that Chirp had stashed just outside the fence. I dashed forward with the rest of the crew towards what looked like a cleanroom at the center of the hanger, and Chirp swung wide to the right to start hopping between coolant tanks for cover. The depth of my mistake became evident a second later. Three more security guards stepped forward with harness-mounted rattle guns, and the massive form of a Mk II security bot mounted with two anti-vehicle cannons rolled into view behind them.

The first blast from the Mk II security bot singed the top of Chirp’s left ear… and left a 3 meter long molten gash in the floor behind him. The rest of us made it into the research tent before any of the other guards could fire, and Jean fired several shots into the liquid nitrogen tanks around the perimeter, almost instantly filling the tent with thick fog. R9 poked the barrel of his rattle gun out of the tent just long enough to take a couple of wild shots at the Mk II security bot, and pulled back before any of the guards were able to return fire. Unwilling to shoot blindly into a room full of state-of-the-art diagnostic equipment, the guards charged down the sweeping stairs to either side of the security office, taking cover behind the stairs and several maintenance carts as they approached. Not seeing any more gunfire coming from the fog-filled tent, they charged forward as a group, expecting to overwhelm us quickly with their superior numbers, armor, and weapons.

What they did not expect were Gizmo’s grenades, freshly repurposed from the Gen27 fight. He pulled the pin on one and handed me a second, counting down on his free hand the seconds until the guards would reach the tent. On his signal, I pushed open the edge of the tent and threw my grenade following the arc of his. The first explosion ripped through the front line of the rifle-wielding guards, and my grenade a half second later felled three more. Gizmo took the opportunity to pop out and start shooting the Mk II security bot, but his first shot went wide. Billie charged out of the tent at the first gunner. His first blade strike deflected off the gunner’s breastplate, but he reversed the direction of the blade and drove it home through a gap in the armor. Jean landed a glancing shot on the captain and R9 managed to wound another of the gunners. Gizmo bought a little time with his drone, blasting static into the Mk II security bot’s communications array, but it compensated a second later and turned back to the battle. Billie finished off the captain with another swing of his blade, but that left him horribly exposed to the remaining guards.

Billie dove to the ground among a hail of bullets from the military rifle and two rattle guns, but miraculously popped up a second later, bleeding from multiple wounds but somehow still able to fire his blast pistol in return. He stumbled forward, just underneath a fury rifle shot from the Mk II security bot that left another smoldering hole in the floor. The second shot from the bot barely missed me, blowing a wide hole through the tent. Chirp sniped one of the gunners just as he swung his rattle gun around for another volley, and then fired another shot at the security bot as it charged for another blast. I put a round from my hunting rifle right through its central processor just before it fired another lethal volley. I turned to see Billie charging the last gunner, spitting out a feeble “My turn” through a mouthful of blood. Jean shot the gunner dead before he got there.

With Jean supporting the stumbling Billie, Gizmo searched through the equipment of the guards while Chirp sprinted through the open hangar doors to get the pictures we needed. Gizmo came back with an extra infantry laser, and an unlocked data stick with the most recent class-alpha security bulletin - a private data feed that security firms had to pay quite a high subscription price for. We made it out of the compound without running into any more guards, but we flew most of the way back to the ship in silence.

...

Back on the ship, I ran into Chirp in the ship’s mess, and I thought it was as good a time as any to share with him an idea I’d been mulling over.

“Hey Chirp, can we sit down and chat for a bit?”

*chirp?*

“Well, I’m gonna sit. You can climb back up on the counter if you want.”

*happy burble* 

“I was really impressed by your bravery out there today. When those guards poured out into the hanger, I thought we were done for. You almost got fried making a break for the flanking position, but you timed it perfectly, and your crossfire saved Billie from getting shot full of holes. Or more holes, anyway. I don’t know many people who’d have the initiative and guts to do something like that.”

*hint of a toothy smile*

“I’ve been thinking it over, and I want you to have something. I want to give you my lucky sniper rifle. She’s got a bit more punch than your laser, and she always comes through in tight situations. Managed to find the one gap in the armor of that Mk II security bot, right? I think you’ll make better use of her than I can. I want you to continue watching out for the rest of the crew and keeping us safe.”

After a couple of emotional *trills*, “You bet, captain. I can do that.”

...

After the firefight at Haechi Heavy Industries, I decided that the crew should lay low for a couple of days before looking for our next job. When I contacted our Spacebus handler Sisko to deliver the surveillance pictures, I was barely able to stop myself from cussing him out. He could have warned us about the heavy security! It was a miracle none of us got killed! But with a few deep breaths and a couple of punches into a bag that I was imagining to be his rib cage, I got through it. He was impressed with our performance under fire, and paid us a hefty 6 credits. He promised to contact us again if he had any more work that required our particular… skillset.

The downtime was a good opportunity to sign up for some advanced trainings. Most of the crew wasn’t interested, but Gizmo signed up for a mechanic course. He could have taught the ship repair portion in his sleep, but he was fascinated by the bot mechanic training. With all of the fights we’d gotten into recently, he wanted to be able to repair and upgrade R9, and his usual learning strategy of taking things apart and putting them back together again wasn’t going to work on a crew member. I signed up for a pistol marksmanship class. Having passed my sniper rifle onto Chirp, I wanted to prepare to get closer to the front lines. I’d placed second in my Social Duelling class at summer camp, so I knew my way around a set of pistols, but gun battles with gangers and mercenaries were another thing entirely. I considered splurging on a new pair of duelling pistols, but in the end decided to work with the blast pistol and handgun we had. The crew is tight on credits, and I promised dad that I was going to pay my own way from now on.
