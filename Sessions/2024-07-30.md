### Battle

The sand runners covered the distance surprisingly fast. Like an onrushing cloud of grasshoppers, the large sprinting lizards alternated between launching themselves through the air with their powerful webbed hind feet and ducking into thickets of dune grass.

We were still spread out in pairs across the face of the dune. Luckily, this dispersed the sand runners as they attempted to swarm all of us simultaneously. 

I was paired with Jone. I hurled a frakk grenade down the dune. The resulting boom threw up a haze of sand and viscera. Jone aimed her plasma rifle and blew the leg off of one of the disorganized survivors.

The two K’Erin Khans were to our right. Khanda smoothly executed two of the runners leading the pack, opening up a path for Khanjar to a larger pack leader. The warrior cursed as he saw that he would lose kills if he waited for blade range, so he drew his rifle and executed the pack leader. 

Simon and Rosey were beyond the Khans. They each dropped one of the rushing mob, but they were falling back, trying to find either cover or better footing on the shifting sands. 

Despite this opening salvo, only one runner dove back into the sand. The rest continued their charge, hissing loudly and flashing their teeth as they closed to biting range. 

Khanjar grinned as he drew his glare sword and sent one spinning back across the dune to his left. Immediately to his right, another sand runner’s head burst as Khanda sighted down the barrel of her auto rifle.

On our side of the dune, Jone’s shots sounded from behind me as I dashed to my left. I splattered one of the runners across the wreckage behind it with my auto rifle. 

But then the swarm was fully on us. I fumbled for my cling fire gun as they rained down on me, tearing at my armor. Two of them fell back, engulfed in flame. 

Through the flurry, I saw Khanjar disembowel two of them before the rest of the swarm bore him down, concealing him from view. Further on, I could hear Simon screaming over the steady rattle of his auto rifle. I saw the blue flashes of Rosey’s shocking machine pistol. 

But two of the runners on me were now burning. Either the smell or their screams sent another one turning and diving into the sand. “Help the others!” I yelled to Jone over my shoulder without taking my eyes off the nearest runner. At the edge of my vision, I saw Jone sprint over the sand and raise her rifle to her shoulder. The sound of her shots overlapped with that of Khanda’s: more runners fell. 

And suddenly the onrushing tide was broken. The last runner on our side of the dune fell to the sand. I hesitated, spinning around to spot the next attack. 

Rosey was body-blocking for Simon, shocking stragglers with her pistols. Another dove into the sand, and another fell still at Rosey’s feet 

Then, like a sandstorm, it was over. The small dune valley was quiet again except for the rustling of dune grass in the breeze. 

### Post-battle

We quickly combed through the wreckage for the black box. Khanda and I pulled data with the scanner, Jone kept a lookout for runners, and the rest of the crew salvaged some valuable parts from the broken ship *(5 credits)*. They also found a body, already eaten to the bone by sand runners. They stripped it of its damaged combat armor and deflector shield. The tech looked like elite Unity military grade to me. 

We hurried back up the dune to the transport. Khanjar promised he’d sprint faster next time when it wasn’t over soft sand *(+1 speed)*. Simon and I both felt lucky that we’d made it through without any damage *(+1 luck)*. 

The transport was still there.  We loaded in. It wove slowly along the dune roads back to the city. It swung by the spaceport where we dropped off most of the crew before it carried me and Jone back to the pawn shop. The transport stopped in a parking garage two blocks from the shop, so Jone and I approached once more on foot.  

The bot in the front room buzzed us into the back again.  However, this time the room was empty.  The workbench had been cleared.  A pict receiver was sitting on the empty surface. I pressed the blinking connect button.

A moment later, the elegant older woman appeared on the screen. A metal wall formed a featureless background behind her.  "Forgive me that I could not be there in person, but we prefer not to meet twice in the same venue. Were you successful in retrieving the data from the wreck?"

I nodded and held up the scanner in its leather case.

"Excellent. You can plug it into the cable attached to this console."  

I did so. For a couple minutes, the woman's eyes flicked back and forth as she scanned through the uploading data.

"You've done well.  This is a treasure trove, on multiple fronts.

"As relates to your particular interest in Teal Division, the flight manifest confirms that they have an outpost in the **Balox Nebula**. That's a Fringe red zone. This ship came from there. The data here confirms a couple of our theories *(2 rumors)*: They are using existing Unity military bases and outposts as launch points. I wouldn't be surprised if they are actually housed somewhere on those bases. Although the exact source of this ship's flight path has been wiped, the trajectory suggests the **Trellium** system.

"I'm currently downloading a coded message to the scanner. Take the scanner with you to Trellium. When you arrive, you'll receive an address and time via cortex message. Be there, and you'll be contacted. The code word will be "Panda Bear". Hand over the scanner and you'll be compensated. Our local contact there may also have more information."

"What's your angle in all of this?" I asked.

She smiled. "That would be my angle. We'll be in touch when you reach Trellium."

The pict feed cut out.
The backdoor was padlocked shut, so Jone and I headed back out the front of the pawn shop. We walked to the nearest subterranean rail entrance and rode back to the Tail-End.

## Turn #16

I immediately put in for a red zone license. It was expensive, but we met all of the requirements. We were approved early the following morning. We fired up the engines, contacted traffic control, and were back in the Black before lunch.

### Travel

The warp jump was a long one. Everyone tried to find some way to amuse themselves.  I saw Khanjar reading a book _(+3 XP)_.  Jone binged multiple seasons of _The Sympsons_. She began to quote the show over meals.  I was glad when we finally broke warp and headed planetside again.

### World

We docked on **Trellium XII**. Red zones are dangerous areas of the Fringe, systems prone to war or invasion. They're designated with Roman rather than Arabic numerals.

The Trellium system was littered with colonized asteroids and dwarf planets.  Trellium XII was a rocky oblong, just a little too small to have become spherical. A massive central grav generator made the place habitable, though the generator also produced a _null field_ that interfered with any sort of transport tech. Tellium XII was originally colonized as a space station with plans for terraformation. However, an invasion left the planet unoccupied for a couple decades. By the time Unity re-established control of the system, the original terraforming plants had gone wild, covering the place in an _overgrown_ tangle.  However, on the bright side, the grav generator was still intact, and so the plants actually created a thin but breathable atmosphere.  Colonists were no longer restricted to the enclosed hab stations.

We touched down in one of the two polar spaceports. After the long warp jump, the crew was eager to get out and stretch their legs.  I also hadn't been contacted yet, and I figured it would help allay any local suspicions if we presented ourselves as a typical Fringe trading vessel.

**Simon** got right to it, unloading a few personal trinkets and other cargo. **I** joined him in the trading bazaars. We picked up a hazard suit and a damaged beam light.

The **Khan**s _explored_ more widely, chatting with the locals.  Khanjar returned with a package to deliver offworld. 

**Jone** and **Ben-E** soon headed back to the ship to hit the _training_ sims. **Twitch** and **Rosey** similarly retired to the *repair* bench, working on a hand flamer and combat armor. 

### Job

Late that afternoon, a cortex message came through from an unregistered address. It included only a time and an address. The time was a couple hours later. The address was a large open mercantile plaza.  I guess we would just _move (through)_ from one end to the other and wait for our contact, or contacts, to see us.  

I looped the scanner strap over my shoulder again and put on a long coat over top of it.

Rosey originally wasn't going to join us as she was still finishing up her work on the flamer. However, as we headed down the loading ramp, she called after us and hurried to catch up _(-story point)_. Given what was about to happen in the plaza, I'm glad she did. 

When we reached the plaza, half of the shops were already closing for the night. We spread out a little and strolled among the plants, some potted and contained, some wild and sprawling. 

Suddenly I saw a short balding man stop a few strides ahead of me _(person of interest)_. He adjusted the paper shopping bag he carried. He reached into it and pulled out a stuffed panda bear, which he tucked under one arm.  He adjusted some of the other small boxes in the shopping bag, and then he slipped the panda back into the bag.  As he did so, he glanced up at me and made brief eye contact.  His expression was inscrutable. He then turned and continued on his way, heading into a nearby plaza exit to my right. 

As I turned to follow him, I heard someone gasp. I glanced back to my left.  People were hurrying out of the plaza in all directions. A couple of them were running.  On the far side of the plaza, seven bots--no, seven Soulless--strode meaningfully in our direction.  Their polished body armor gleamed in the fluorescent light of the storefronts. They cradled a mix  of marksman rifles and blast rifles in their arms. The lead one raised one hand and ignited a thrumming power claw. 

I don't know know if these guys were originally coming for us or Mr. Panda Bear, but, either way, it looks like they'd decided to start with us.
