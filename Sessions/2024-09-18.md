*Spent some time discussing possible mission mechanics. Decided to try out a respawning mechanic where it's only possible to remove a figure if it panics off the board, otherwise it just respawns at the end of the turn.*

### Battle

The team responded quickly to my shout of warning, but the void rippers were fast!  Ben-E winged one as it led the pack, but the rest of us missed.  In the space of a breath, they were on us.

Khanjar hit one flanking batch with his flamer: Two of them winked out, and a third banked sharply, leaving a streak of flame through the air. 

Meanwhile, another ripper dove down into Rosey's shoulder joint.  I saw sparks, and her arm dropped limply to her side.  Rosey calmly stepped back, and Khanda executed the ripper from behind me with her auto rifle.  The body disappeared back into the ether before it hit the ground.  Khanda took a bead on a second ripper, but a third dive-bombed her. She was forced to roll to one side, fending it off with the butt of her rifle. 

Shimmers continued to flash at all points over our heads. Another flaming ripper soared past my ear. As the flames on it died, I reignited it with a burst of cling fire.

As I turned back to the battle, five rippers descended on Ben-E, driving him back into a tree and surrounding him.  Rosey beeped and charged forward once more to his defense.  Ben-E managed to get his gun up against the flurry of razor-fins, blasted one of the rippers, and stumbled forward. Then Rosey was up to him, propping him up, half carrying him toward the fence beyond.

We were dying out here.  Rippers were dropping, but they disappeared before they hit the ground while more flickered into the air through the shimmers.  "Khanda, fall back!" I yelled. "Tell Twitch to get out here with the ship!"

Now another swarm was gathering around Khanjar. I sprinted forward, spewing cling fire as I ran. Khanjar rolled out of the swarm, then he leapt up to cut a big fat ripper out of the air between us. 

I could hear the metallic scraping of void ripper fins down my armored back.  On the far side of the fence, I saw Ben-E fall. The hot punching hiss of Jone's laser-rifle shot blew the ripper off my back.

Then, suddenly, the air wavered all around us, and the void rippers winked out. I blinked and heard a bush rustle ahead to my left.  With a shrill growl, a vent crawler leapt out of it onto Rosey.  As the crawler clawed at her chest plate, Rosey wearily lifted her machine pistol.  The vent crawler danced in a hail of sparking gun fire.  It fell off her onto the vine-choked rubble at her feet.

I was still breathing hard. Oxygen-starved flashes wavered across my vision, but there were no more void ripper shimmers.  The battle was over.

### Post-Battle

Whether the void rippers had fled because of the lone vent crawler or because we'd managed to harvest some unknown quota of them wasn't clear. 

I hauled myself over the fence.  Peering over the bushes, I didn't see any increased signs of activity in the Unity base below.  It looked like our battle hadn't drawn their attention.

Rosey was hunched over Ben-E's prone body, chiding herself for letting this happen.  Lubricant was pooling beneath him around his twisted hand cannon.  Rosey had one of the plates removed from his torso. The soldering iron in her hand threw up sparks among the tubes and wires in Ben-E's gaping abdomen cavity.  

None of the rest of us could help her with that, so I ordered a quick sweep of the bushes.  

We found where the vent crawler had come from. There was a solid metal access hatch, now open, that led down into a dark vertical shaft below.  An acrid metallic tang wafted from the tunnel. We were already battle-weary, and we weren't outfitted for a pitch-black tunnel fight in poisonous fumes. I closed the hatch but ensured that it didn't lock. We'd just found our back entrance to the the Unity base below. *(+rumor)*

The others found that either the vent crawlers or the void rippers had downed some other security team.  They picked up about 7 credits worth of gear scattered over the hillside, as well as a personal trinket, a battle dress, a dented hover board, and a broken multi-cutter. 

"He's stable," Rosey reported.  She was trying to left Ben-E to her shoulder in a fireman's carry, but her own arm wasn't cooperating.  Khanjar and I were able to lift him between us. With Khanda and Twitch now on the vox, we were able to arrange a discreet pickup less than a click away.

Once we were settled back at the space port again, we took stock.  I thanked Jone for the accurate firing (*+1 CS*).  Twitch paid several credits to download a Bot Technician course to a data slate. He glowered as he headed into the med bay with the slate.  He spent most of the night working on a comatose Ben-E.  I think his language would have been much fouler had Rosey not also been in the room.

A bored Khanjar flipped through the course catalog.  He spent the evening with this feet up on the couch, scrolling through some sort of security training. 

Khanda passed me in the hall.  "I can't find my blast pistol," she said.  

"A similar thing happened to Twitch a while back," I said.  "I think he built a scanner to find it, so I'm sure he'll be able to you find yours tomorrow."

I spent the evening learning what I could on the cortex about vent crawlers and the Unity base. *(+rumor)*

When I got up early the next morning, I peeked into the med bay.  Ben-E was still lying on one of the tables.  Wires ran up to a screen above him, where diagnostic output scrolled by.  His facial sensors were illuminated again. A stained buffing rag lay beside him, covering his long right hand. 

I thought of Khanda's missing pistol.  Yeah, Twitch will probably find that later today.

## Turn #19

### World

By mid-morning, people were to their tasks.  **Jone** hit the *training* sims. Ben-E similarly ran through some physical recalibration exercises after last night's repairs.

**Twitch** and **Rosey** *repaired* the hoverboard and multi-cutter we'd picked up on the hill. 

**Simon** continued to work on building his *trading* empire, picking up a stabilizer gun mod and some very questionable contraband merchandise.  **I** made sure we had enough fuel in the tanks to leave the planet in a hurry.

I sent the Khans out to *explore* around the Unity base a bit. Khanjar took in the sights out front, casing out their security based on what he'd recently learned in his course. Khanda returned with a sample of gas from the vents. *(+rumor)*

### Job

There was no sense in delaying any further. This was the next step in our mission. Pawn, whoever they were, had led us here. We now had the details we needed to get into the base. It was only inside that base that we'd have a chance to learn more about Teal Division.  I knew we were on the right track because no normal Unity base would stock their base's access tunnels with vent crawlers or allow void rippers to proliferate in their grounds.

We outfitted ourselves with some of our new gear. Jone upgraded her las rifle to an auto rifle. We tuned our haz suits to the nerve toxin sample that Khanda had secured.

Then, with dusk falling once more, we headed back up the hill and popped open the access hatch in the thick Trellium undergrown.  

The darkness yawned before us.
