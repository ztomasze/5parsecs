### Captain's Log

In his sleuthing on the deepweb, Chirp had found an invitation for the next Gen27 meetup, at a park only a couple tube stops north of our base of operations. We loaded our gear into a pair of athletic duffels and took the hypertube out to Neo Brixton. We arrived just as the sun was starting to set, and we found the Gen27 crew without much trouble. They were grouped around a campfire and two picnic tables, with a couple of recruits taking turns slackwebbing between two trees. Each of them had the characteristic shaved head and cross tattoo on the right temple of Gen27 zealots. They were armed, but only with colony rifles and shotguns - not a lot of money in crusading against genetic augmentation, it seems. Nothing we couldn’t handle.

Chirp and I climbed on top of a set of monkey bars to get a better look through our scopes so we could make a plan of attack. I motioned for Chirp to move down a few bars so I could get a clearer angle… and he took that as the signal to start shooting. We really need to work on our comms. His first laser blast caught one of the shotgun-wielders in the shoulder, blasting clean through but not taking him down. The Gen27 camp exploded into chaos as they all grabbed weapons and turned to charge our position. R9 opened up with the rattle gun, blowing down one of the zealots with the second bullet. Gizmo followed behind R9 staying in cover, waiting for the initial hail of bullets to die down. Billie ran right up the center, yelling “Stealth!” at the top of his lungs. I’d asked him to approach with stealth in our original battle plan. At least he’s trying to follow instructions, in his own way.

We set our weapons and readied for their charge. One of them swung around the side of the massive water tank that Billie was hiding behind, but R9 blew his legs out from under him before he could fire on the surprised Billie. R9, standing out in the open and clearly the most dangerous threat, somehow managed to dodge or deflect a hail of bullets, including a shot from a high-powered sniper rifle from one of the zealots that was working his way towards a good sniping position like Chirp and I had. Chirp tried to take out another zealot with a shotgun preparing to ambush Billie, but only landed a glancing hit. I scrambled across the monkey bars to try to get a clear shot, but with the weight of my rifle I wasn’t able to get a stable position to shoot from.

Without warning, Billie charged out from behind cover, firing directly at the zealot with the sniper rifle, landing a glancing hit. Their entire crew turned in surprise to fire on the giant shouting man charging them. Gizmo was able to distract their leader for a second by flying one of his surveillance drones centimeters from his face, and Billie skewered another through the chest and skull with his blade, but then he paused to say “Your turn.” I have no idea where he got the idea that people in a fight to the death took turns attacking each other, but it seems pretty deeply ingrained. One of the shotgun specialists blasted him in the back, a rifler shot him in the leg from the front. A third had drawn a bead directly on Billie’s chest, but miraculously when he pulled the trigger, Gizmo’s surveillance drone blew into pieces instead of Billie as it circled around for another pass. Billie took this as a sign that it was again his turn and he slashed down another one of them. R9 fired into the melee, his usual efficiency hampered a bit by needing to avoid hitting the wildly swinging Billie. At the loss of his drone, Gizmo screamed out in frustration and finished the leader with his autorifle. Jean moved up to help, and the closest zealot to Billie turned and ran in a blind panic. He seems to have that effect on people. Chirp soared down from the monkey bars and sniped the last zealot from mid-air as he glided past his cover. With that, the park settled into silence.

We had only a few moments to search the zealots before packing our gear and high-tailing it back to the hypertube. The police would arrive in a few minutes, and we didn’t want to be there when they did. Gizmo pulled a couple of black-market Frakk grenades from a duffel bag, but those, a personal trinket, and 1 credit were all we could salvage. While Chirp still needs some work on combat signalling, he’s getting better at split-second repositioning between shots in combat. All of his usual frenetic movements seem to disappear as soon as the shooting starts.

We got off the tube a few stops early at the trade center, both to throw off any pursuit and to liquidate some of our goods to raise more money for protective gear for us and R9. As we were walking by one of the bounty boards, the flash of a price update caught my eye. One “Leo Kowalski” jumped nearly 100x - from near the bottom to the very top of the list! Gizmo pulled his hand terminal and flagged it to the auto-moderation system as fraudulent, temporarily dropping it from the board. He explained to no one in particular that this was the only game-theory optimal response; if it was fake, then no harm done, and if it was real, it would buy us a few days head start before the poster noticed and appealed the moderation decision.

When we got back to the ship, we piled into the ship’s mess, and Gimzo pulled out a bottle of synth-gin from behind a latched wall panel to celebrate. We’d sold off all of the high-end stuff at the trade center, but you’ve gotta have a comfort drink every once in a while to celebrate your victories. Any interested sponsors, please DM me. Gizmo toasted Jean's continued living, the statistical improbability of Billie surviving so many shots without any major injuries, his fallen drone (which would undoubtedly be rebuilt by morning), and my unexpectedly competent leadership as the new captain. At the last one, Chirp slammed his empty glass down on the counter and bounded out of the room without a word. After a few moments of awkward silence, Billie shouted out his now familiar “My turn!” and launched into another toast as the rest of the room burst into laughter.

As the celebrations were winding down, I reminded Gizmo that he should check on Chirp before heading back to his workshop. Gizmo found Chirp in his quarters, turning over the scrap pistol Gizmo had built for him in his hand. The side of the pistol grip was unlatched and open, revealing a small hidden compartment. Two interlocking gears, each with five teeth with letters engraved on each one, were cradled in his other hand.

“Are you feeling okay Chrip? Captain Julie said to check on you.”

After a barely-perceptible squeak at the title, Chirp replied, “Yeah Gizmo, I’m just tired from the battle. Thanks for checking.”
