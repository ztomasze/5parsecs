### Battle

The swarm brood keened, and I could hear the tearing of vegetation. Khanjar yelled and sprinted into the reeds ahead of us. A piercing screech told us that the brood was now one fewer.  Rosey, murmuring "Oh dear, Khanjar!", ran after the K'Erin. A rapid blast from her machine pistol must have dropped another one.
  
The rest of us moved to put our backs to this thicket, given that we could hear the echolocating keens of a second pack of the brood circling around to our left.

The brood packs charged us on both fronts.  To our right, Khanjar leapt up over the grass at the pack leader. His glare sword came down hard on one of the leader's articulated forelegs. While it reared up over Khanjar, Rosey dropped it with another machine gun blast.

We moved closer to that battle as the second pack broke from cover to our left.  Simon called out, "I see something! I'll be right back, Captain."  

"Not now, Simon!" But he was already ducking into the reeds behind Rosey. Just as he passed, Khanjar's glare sword flickered again, and it was like someone had detonated a gallon can of blueberry pie filling. Purple blood and viscera splattered across the reeds in a twelve-foot arc.

Then the closing second pack was upon us, weaving between the shots from Khanda and Jone. I lit up the lead one with cling fire, and it died with a warbling high-pitched scream. Two of them closed on the splattered Khanjar. He cleaved cleanly down through the sensory facial bulbs of the first one, but the second one leapt over its dying companion and bore Khanjar down into the green. But a moment later, it went still. Khanjar struggled to push the carcass off of him and extract his sword from its thorax.

I turned my cling fire gun on the last one. Its keening echoed out across the mud and reeds, and then the marsh went quiet again.

### Post-Battle

Simon stood up out of the reeds a few steps away holding a plasma rifle. "It looks like the last crew came out on a speeder. The wreckage is just over here."  

While I kept a lookout and Khanda swapped the power pack into the sensor tower, the rest of the crew stripped the speeder.  We found a few parts that might help with a ship expansion, as well as a deflector field and a jump belt, although both were damaged.  I could hear Twitch sigh over the vox comm.

"Nice find, Simon. Especially to spot it in the middle of a firefight.." _(+1 reactions)_

I thought about scouting the area for egg clutches or brood spawn, but it seemed a hopeless task given only our small-fire weapons.  We'd need advanced bio-scanners and an immolator to do a serious job of it.

So we slogged back through the muck to the ship.  Once we landed back at the spaceport docks, I quickly cleaned up and headed with Khanda back to AGTAR. While a secretary efficiently transferred seven credits to my account, I told her boss about the brood swarm. He assured me they'd purge the area.

Back at the ship that night, the local cortex _news_ feeds were buzzing with rumors of brood swarm meteoroids spotted in the system (_+2 invasion risk_). Officials assured everyone that the reports were overstated and that situation was under control. I contacted the local DIRM office to report the local brood swarm. I dropped Paul Bosch's name from our work on Carpathium 9. I got a polite "your report has been noted" response.

For some reason, that got under my skin. I went into the ship's galley for a drink. Half of the crew was lounging there, and they turned their heads as I came in. 

"What's got you so hot and bothered, Captain?" Jone asked. 

"Does it show?" I said. I told them about the invasion threat and my DIRM call.  "I think they're covering it up," I said. "I think Unity is going to put another world at risk to save money and face." 

"Don't get _political_ about it, Captain. If you're worried about it, we can leave, head further out into the Fringe. Unity isn't going to look after you or this crew. That's your job." 

"Yeah, well, sometimes Unity seems to do a little more harm than good. Especially given where the path from Holrith's Crater is leading us. Maybe someone should do something about that."

## Turn #14

### World

While I continued to mull over Unity's slide into moral turpitude, I did my best to shelve those thoughts in the morning. 

Instead, we turned our attention to the regular tasks of a freelancer crew: the work necessary to keep a ship like this running, the crew fed, and enough fuel in the tanks to take to the black when you can't stomach the rules or the corruption any more.

**Jone** hit the *training* sims.

**Twitch** and **Rosey** leaned over the *repair* bench in his crowded berth, bringing a deflector field and camo cloak back to life.  At one point, I heard Twitch yell, "No, Rosey, not the red wire!" A moment later he sighed. "That was close. You splice the green and the blue, never the red. Do you know what happens when you run an inverse current through the red wire on a thermoptic generator?"

I never found out, because **Simon** and **Khanda** came in then from _trading_. They dumped off a bunch more damaged gear: a hand flamer and stealth gear, and a dented, but possibly working, auto-rifle that looked like they'd fished it out of a scrap heap. Twitch put his face in his hands for a moment, took a deep breath, and turned back to the repair bench.

**Khanjar** was close behind Simon and Khanda. He'd _discovered_ that a dropship of Unity grunts had just come in from Caturix Prime. "We could hit them before they know we're coming!" he exclaimed. 

"No, Khanjar," I said. "I doubt they know we are here. Let's not look for rival fights when we don't need to."

**I** headed out to find us another *job*.  I could use the fresh air.

### Job

Although I did see a public job posting from sector government, I was definitely not in the mood to court Unity today. Luckily, Eldar Frankenmuir had left me a message. 

It turns out Eldar had another exotic animal job for us. As I stood once more in his scenic foyer, he showed me a pict feed of a cave mouth in a remote area.  "I like to watch the krorg," he explained. "I had a pict sensor installed so I could watch this particular wild pack.  However, I fear that perhaps the adults have run into some sort of accident. I have seen a small cub frolicking in the entrance of the cave these past few weeks, but he does not follow the rest of the pack when they go to hunt. I have grown quite attached to the little family, so I'd like to hire you to recover the cub. Quickly, before he wanders off or any harm comes to him."

I looked at him levelly, but I didn't say anything. This guy watches packs of armored killer bears? And what is he going to do with a wild cub? Other than possibly sell it for a great pile of credits on the black market. Most underground gladiatorial rings would kill to have a krorg.

I continued to say nothing while I nodded and took the job.

Following the coordinates he gave us, we set down in the wilds several hundred clicks from the city. Everyone suited up, grabbing some of the new gear coming out of Twitch's berth: camo cloak, deflector screen, auto rifle, and a plasma rifle. Krorg are no joke.  They're over 12 feet tall when they stand up on their hind legs, their claws are 8 inches long, and their thick hide protects better than three inches of kevlar.

We made our way into the cave. It was thickly musty inside, humid, and very dark. Using a beam light, we located the cub. The little guy was at least three feet long, so Khanjar had to noose him. The cub growled and mewled… and then we heard an answering roar from outside the cave.

Yeah, I can't say I was surprised.
