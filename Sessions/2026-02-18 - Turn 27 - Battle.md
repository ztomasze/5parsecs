### Ship's Log

#### Battle

+ We come out of the rail system to a park and corporate plaza crawling with punks. 
+ 0) Super seize: Chirp pops up out of the subway tunnel and executes a punk.  Julie and Billie follow close behind.  On the other side of the tracks, R9 and Jean lead the charge, with Gizmo stays in cover in the entrance.  One panics away. 
+ 1) The punks are still stunned and slow to react. R9 rockets into their midst and drops one in a hail of fire, and Gizmo tosses a frak grenade, killing 2 of them and revealing a couple more who dive into cover.  Jean wounds one and kills another.  Meanwhile, on the plaza, Julie hops up onto the fountain lip and execute the two punks on the other side.  Chirp pokes his head into the foyer and wounds the K'Erin leader. Billie follows up, cleaving through a shotgunner first, to knock the leader back. 
+ 2) Gizmo opens with another grenade, killing 3 more. R9 kills the wounded shotgunner, and drops another. Billie kills two punks. Chirp runs for high ground. Jean blasts a couple incoming punks and then fends one off in melee.  Billie takes a couple shots, knocking him back into the wall. Captain bursts into the building and ends the boss. 
+ 3) Jean ends the last two punks. One last one pokes his head out and R9 kills him.  (Chirp's machine pistol jams. A tree falls in the park and a bench explodes in the plaza. R9's rattlegun is smoking hot.)
