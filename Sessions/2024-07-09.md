_Despite over a month to do it, Zach is behind on the recap for this one. Combat went by fast in only 2 rounds, but we had a good chat about Bill's new house and movies and ended up lingering fairly late._

> On: [[../Planets/Goldeng 8|Goldeng 8]]

### Battle

We moved in fast, before they could react. 

Khanda and Simon swung up onto a nearby walkway for sniper positions with their auto-rifles. While the spaceport scum hunkered down behind their fence, Simon dropped their leader and Khanda dropped another and wounded a third. I downed a fourth.

That opening salvo changed some opinions in a hurry, and two more of them fled.
  
We continued to fire at the stragglers, picking them off. The big bruiser rushed our way, but Khanjar stepped off his hoverboard in front of him and took him out.

And with that we had the taxiway to ourselves again.  Maybe Khanda and I could have handled this job alone after all.

We strolled down to the destination hanger. After proving our identities over a pict-screen, the courier buzzed us in. Her ship was already idling, ready to go, and I handed over the carrier. _Mrreow-thunk._ The job was done.

### Post-Battle

A short call later, Eldar Frankenmuir wired me 5 credits.

On the way back out, we picked through the debris of the spaceport scum encampment.  We snagged a damaged hotshot pack and bipod. Pretty nice gear, though poorly cared for.  We also found the contact info of a local corporation willing to hire anyone for odd jobs, which might explain the gear.  We pocketed the info, just in case we ever come up short on work.  It felt like tearing off a vox number slip from one of those street-post fliers for work-at-home jobs: I hope we're never that desperate.

On the bright side, that firefight had gone by fast.  It seems the whole crew is a well-oiled machine these days _(Khanda, Simon,  Khanjar: +1 reactions)_.  I'm lucky to have them. _(+1 luck)_

As we returned to the ship, Rosie worried whether Twitch would have room in his overflowing repair crate for this new gear. And it's not just Twitch's berth that's getting tight lately.  With all of Simon's trade goods, the whole _Tail-End_ is starting to feel cramped. We should probably put in an extra couple berths before we take to the black again.

Simon used the cramped state of the ship to talk us into a detour for a nice dinner out to celebrate our first successful job on Goldeng 8. We went to one of those fancy hot table places where the chef flips their knives and cooks the food in front of you, where you can get drunk on saki at the bar and end the night wildly singing karaoke in one of the private rooms in the back. Khanjar watched the chef's bladework with a bemused skepticism.  I wasn't sure how many of us would still be around for the karaoke phase. 

I excused myself for a trip to the bar. As I took a stool there to wait for my order, I suddenly paused at a familiar scent: vanilla and musk, sweet and heady.  I turned my head and she was sitting there, watching me with a smile.  "Hello, Halden. Fancy running into you here."  

"I find it hard to believe this is a _chance meeting_, Jone."

Jone. I can't say I hadn't thought of her over the years. The smell of her perfume and of her body underneath brought all those thoughts rushing back. She had tawny skin, amber eyes, and an allure I can't describe. She'd grown up on a feral planet, and somehow that wild animal draw had never left her. A memory came to me of the two of us lying sprawled on a wrinkled bed, still sweating and only half covered by a thin sheet, as the distant sound of jungle drums wafted in on the humid night air.  There's a Wendy in this story, but there's also a Tiger Lily.

Yet Jone was also canny, _savvy_, and deadly with a laser rifle. 

She put her chin in her hand and said, "I'm in a bit of trouble, Halden. I could use a ride."

"I'm working on something," I said.

"I know," she said.  "Shaking the tree for a particular Division. I've heard a _rumor_ myself."

"Look, I've got a crew. I'm a Captain. I'm not going to put them in… any more danger than they already are. Do you have some heat on you?"

Jone looked at me incredulously. "Nothing I couldn't give the slip at the same time I found you."

I sighed. I could see the curves of her outline out of the corner of my eye, and I could still smell that sweet jungle night. "Okay," I said. "I can take you on."

And, I thought to myself, we're definitely getting those new crew quarters. They say to keep trouble close to you, but not too close.

## Turn #13

### World

Although I caught a couple raised eyebrows and questioning glances, the crew accepted Jone's addition without complaint.  She came with brand new *crew quarters*, so there were some compensating perks.  

Then we got down to our usual business.

**Simon** checked the _trade_ link, and then he and **Khanjar** came back with an auto-rifle, a glare sword, and an extra blade.  They each tried offering their weapons to Jone, who gracefully declined. It seems I'm not the only one who finds her presence heady.

**Twitch** and **Rosey** spent an afternoon pawing through the _repair_ crate, fixing up a seeker sight and a bipod.

**Jone** hit the *training* sim, while **I** took **Khanda** with me to get some fresh air and clear my head… and to find another _job_.

### Job

With the distraction of the crew quarters install and Jone joining the crew, I was feeling short on time, so I did stoop to reaching out to the corporation contact we'd found. They tried to woo us with the lure of sending a private transport around to pick us up, but they were also giving us a fast sell on a low paying yet urgent job.  I passed.

Then Khanda came back with a winner: **AGTAR**, Allied Gas Technology & Refinery.  They're a local scientific org that does corporate-funded research to improve natural gas production.  Some of the marshes out beyond the city here sparkle like starfields from all the burning gas flares on the scattered wells and refineries.

The job was simple: One of their sensor stacks needed a new power cell. They'd already hired another contractor to _deliver_ one, but they apparently flaked on the job.  Now the sensor tower had completely died, so this was a rush job to get it back online.  Slogging through the marsh to the tower would be slow gross work (_slippery ground_), but the job paid really well.

This should also be an easy job to get Jone out into the field. Our usual work is a far cry from glamorous urban spy work.

We flew the _Tail-End_ out to the marsh, putting down on the nearest dry ground about a half-click from the tower.  Twitch picked up some large life readings on the sensor, so he said he'd stay behind to run the scanner drones for us.

We suited up and slogged out through the bugs and mud.  As the tower came into view over the waving patches of reeds, we saw a bloated body impaled on the branches of a downed tree.  It seems that maybe the other crew didn't flake after all. 

Just then, Twitch came in over the vox: "Something… No, several somethings are currently converging on your position from the tower." I looked up and saw the reeds ahead start to wave and shake. A distinctive panting keen went up all around us as large forms bounded through the greenery toward us. "_Swarm brood!_" I yelled to the crew.
