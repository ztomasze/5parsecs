### Ship's Log

#### Battle

+ Starting out quest, we head out to explore a crashed ship in the dark of the night, only to get swarmed by a pack of swarm brood.  We find ourselves split into two parties on either side of the downed ship: Jean, R9, Gizmo vs Billie, Chirp, Julie.  (Gloom: 11")
+ (Rain: 9") With Billie's help, we super seize the initiative.  Chirp opens with a kill shot on the lead member... but it rolls back to its feet, still charging.
+ (Rain: 11") Jean and Captain open with some cover fire while the swarm moves in. One leaps on Billie and dies. Chirp kills another. Billie cleaves through one and moves onto the pack leader. Meanwhile, Gizmo grenades and R9 tears through the pack leader with sustained gunfire. 
+ (Rain: 10") Jean and R9 clears out their side. Julie and Billie soften up their side and ends it.
