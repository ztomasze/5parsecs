### Captain's Log

I went out to look for another job, but the pickings were pretty slim. There’s not much excitement in a corporate state like Chaebol 6. I was just about to give up when Chirp popped into my cabin and reported that he’d slipped through a couple of checkpoints and tracked down the band of zealots that had been asking about Jean. That was news to me! Apparently they believe that genetic augmentation is a personal affront to God, and whatever Jean got put her right at the top of their list. They could cause some real trouble if they catch up to us at the wrong time, so we’re going to pay them a visit.

The rest of the crew were up to their usual activities. Billie and Jean were in the sims again; I think they have some sort of high-score competition going on that neither of them wants to talk about. Gizmo and R9 went out on another shopping run. R9 came back with bottles of Glenfiddich 21 this time - we really need to sit him down and talk about his purchasing habits. He doesn’t even drink the stuff. Gizmo brought back another blade that Jean snatched up before Billie noticed. Jean’s pretty handy with a blade, and I think she wanted something to defend herself with if we ran into any more power claws.
