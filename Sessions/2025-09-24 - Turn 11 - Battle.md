### Ship's Log

#### Battle

+ Church fight - ferals trashing the place
+ Despite not seizing the initiative, we had a wild opening round: Chirp executes their leader off the pulpit, R9 blasts down the center aisle from the double doors with his rattle gun, Billie races down the aisle yelling while Julie and Jean blast shots over his head, and Gizmo drops a finale smoke grenade to cover the party's approach.
