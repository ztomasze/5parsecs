_Commercial Resourcing's colo took Wiggle, so we spent an hour considering other rooms, talking about rules, and eating dinner.  A little more rules discussion at the end of the session concerning Defensive AI (and the ability to too easily kite-and-snipe them) meant we didn't wrap up until 11pm+ again._

### Battle

As we cut into the OmegaGen lab, the security enforcers did the same on the far side of the room.  Rows of desks and lockers filled one side of the lab.  On the other side stood clusters of vats, canisters, and control stacks.  In the far corner was a controlled environment room and a stout command desk. In the center of the room stood a large support pillar, covered in wires and pipes, surrounded by a low railing.

While the enforcers scanned the room with flashlights, Khanda sprinted ahead and hopped the railing to the pillar.  The rest of us wove between the vats.

Rosey broke cover first. She dashed to the corner of the sealed room and dropped one of the enforcers with a flanking hail of gunfire.  Thankfully, I'd suggested she load up with nonlethal rubber rounds for this one.

The enforcers returned fire. I leapt one of the railings and laid down some intimidating cover fire, blasting long gouges with my hand cannon in the command desk they were crouched behind.  Simon followed me.  When he squeezed the trigger of his auto rifle, the bright tracers arced in the dark, blowing apart light fixtures above us with a shower of sparks. Apparently he and Khanjar hadn't focused on shooting skills in their last training round.

Twitch worked his way around through the dark of the far side of the room, and Khanda gave us the "all done" whistle: The camera was installed.

Seeing our firepower, the two remaining enforcers seemed to have a change of heart, glancing back at how they might withdraw to better cover.  Just then, Khanjar dove in, swinging his blade down and lopping off the woman's arm near the elbow.  K'Erin really forget about "non-lethal" when the blood frenzy comes on them.

The rest of us continued to lay down covering fire, with Khanda, me, and Simon's blazing auto rifle tearing into the stout metal desk.  I called for us to retreat; the job was done. But I don't think anyone could hear me over the gunfire in the close confines of the lab.  I'm pretty sure I saw the last enforcer take a hit, but he proved to be a _tough_ son-of-a-bitch.  He was returning fire when Khanjar cut in on his right.  While he did manage to hit Khanjar in the gut with a rifle butt, Khanjar dropped him soundly with a blade-hilt punch to the face.

We had to get out of here, but this job had gotten way bloodier than I'd intended.  I didn't want anyone dead on our account.  I rushed forward, pulled the woman's belt from her waist, and tourniquetted the stump of her arm.  It’d probably be three months of physical therapy learning to use a prosthetic, covered by enforcer health insurance.  Too bad we hadn't brought the bionic arm we had lying around the Tail-End to leave as a "sorry about that" gift.

The others were inspecting the sturdy desk we'd pulverized -- that'd make for a good _story_ later.  For some reason, Khanjar was pulling off the tough guy's _boots_.  Twitch was digging around in some of the blasted holes in the desk and pulled out a data drive that was still intact.  Sometimes it's hard to corral my crew's baser instincts.  Still, a theft would be a good cover story for PETAL, and it could lead to an _extra credit_ or two or an open door with a competing _corp (patron)_.

Now it really was time to go! 

We hustled out of there, got free of the external cameras, and stripped off our masks.  With our gear stowed in duffles and packs, we rode the rail back to spaceport.  Khanjar complained most of the way back about the steel boots he'd taken. I still don't understand why he grabbed them in the first place.

### Post-Battle

The next day, I made contact with PETAL. I could tell they were unhappy with what had happened to the guards, but they paid us 6 credits.  The bearded gent told me one more time: "No further contact. Ever."

I stopped for a quiet _dinner_ on my own before heading back to the ship. I wanted some time to think _(+1 XP)_. My crew did well, but I need to remember to play to our strengths.  As we get better, I think we can handle some seedier jobs, where we don't have to hold ourselves back in the face of the opposition.

## Turn #3

### World

After a day to revel in the success of our past couple jobs (_story point_), it was time to get back to work.  Docking fees and ship costs rack up fast, and I'd like a little nest egg built up for once we find a solid lead on these Blood Storm mercs.

**Khanda** and **Simon** hit the _training_ sims.  While Simon could use some firing practice, the auto rifle does well enough in more open environments.  They instead focused on evasive maneuver drills, which will hopefully keep them alive in the next scrape _(+1 XP -> +1 Luck)_.

**Twitch** was in his bunk, tools scattered everywhere, working on _repairing_ the beam light he'd purchased.

The rest of us headed into the city.

### Job

While Twitch said he'd reached out to a couple local corporations about the gentech data he'd pulled from the drive, he didn't have anything solid there yet.  Reade at Solari didn't have anything for me either, so I swung by Mr. Golinko's.

He invited me in and told me plainly: "I like you, Mr. Walker, but I don't think we should continue to waste each other's time. I have a _couple jobs_ (_Busy_) that I'd be happy to have you do.  The first is not particularly dangerous (_+1 credit_) nor urgent (_anytime_). So you let me know when you and your crew are ready to start. Until then, you need not stop by again."

I said I appreciated his straightforward approach, and I'd be in touch.  As I rose to go, he said, "In the meantime, an associate of mine might also appreciate your services."  He handed me the contact info.

Three hours later, I was sitting in a private booth of a revolving rooftop restaurant talking to **Quenton Hyland**. He was a rich kid (_wealthy patron_) in his early 20s.  After some awkward small talk, we quickly moved the conversation along to the job.

Quenton was paying well: _+3 credits_ up front to pick up and deliver an atmo speeder from a locked spaceport hangar. No real rush--sometimes this week (_this or next 2 turns_).

The pay didn't add up to the simplicity of the job, even given the seedy location of the hangar.

"Mr. Hyland", I said. "There are certain professions that maintain a tradition of confidentiality. For example, when you talk to your doctor, your lawyer, your priest, or your therapist, they are sworn to keep your conversations private. This is because none of these professions can truly help you solve your problem if they are not privy to the full picture. 

“I like to think the same is true of me and my crew. You don't need to hire a freelancer to play valet, especially not at the price you're offering, unless there's more to this job. When you don't tell me everything, it puts me and my crew at risk.  And we cannot guarantee to solve your problem if we don't know the full nature of that problem. Mr. Golinko recommended us.  That's why I'm here.  If you don’t feel that you can trust me, that's fine.  I'll walk away right now."

He mused for a moment, looking out the window at the skyline, slowly swirling his brandy in its snifter without lifting it from the tablecloth.

"Alright, Walker. Full disclosure then. My father bought me the coupe speeder two years ago as a coming-of-age gift. Unfortunately, I soon smashed it into… a stationary object. There was some damage done on both sides. I was… under the influence at the time, and I spilled nearly a quarter kilo of snowflake in the crash, so I did not hang around. I stashed the speeder in a friend’s hangar out at the spaceport.

“My father smoothed over the incident with the authorities. He told me I was grounded: that I couldn’t fly the speeder until I had it shining again. My father and I do not get along, and I could catch rides with my friends, so I kept putting off the repairs. 

"About a year ago, I took over the rent on the hangar from my friend. More troublesome is that a certain seedy associate of ours, by the name of **TinPin**, hangs with a gang of spaceport scum. He’s considered a _VIP_ on their crew. They’ve set up a squatting area near the hangar. Somehow he knows about the tainted speeder. He’s made some vague suggestions that stop shy of blackmail, but he’s getting bolder. 

"It is unfortunate that I have let the situation linger for this long. However, this month, there seems to be a natural confluence that suggests it is time to resolve it. I have recently come into some funds. My kid sister is about to turn 16, and I would like to give her the renovated speeder, as it largely has bad memories for me at this point. And Mr. Golinko gave me your name. 

"So, yes, there is more to the job. I require professionalism and discretion. Not only do I need you to recover the speeder, but I will need you to deliver it to a certain garage that will be able to clean and renovate it. And then you can deliver it to a particular parking garage."

"Thank you, Mr. Hyland,” I said. "I believe that is exactly the sort of job my crew can handle."

We discussed some of the finer points of the job. Then he gave me a down payment, the hangar location, and an entry code.

### World (cont.)

When I got back to the ship, I learned that **Rosey** had run into some revolutionary looking to buy arms.  Rosey had brought her back to the ship and, with Twitch's help, had sold her nearly all of our spare weaponry. Probably not something I would have condoned if I'd been around, but it did net us some extra credits.

**Khanjar** had also been out looking for _trade_. He returned with a cluster of three grenades.  He'd been happy enough to buy them, but he then cursed that he'd missed the chance to sell them for a better price to the revolutionary.  He was threatening to go after her, so I took them off his hands and divvied them up among the crew.

### Job (cont.)

After dinner, we suited up and rode the ground shuttle across the spaceport to the hangar area. 

It was on a lower level, dimly lit and largely superseded by newer construction elsewhere in the port. As we stepped off the lift, rows of forty-foot-wide hangar doors stretched off in a corridor nearly a quarter mile long. The open space of the corridor was about two hundred feet wide to leave room for either taxiing small craft or fueling and loading vehicles.
  
Here and there along the corridor, we passed hangar spaces that had been replaced by service facilities: a fueling station, a machine shop, a burger joint, a ship supply store, a noodle restaurant, a ship’s elevator to the upper levels. 

As we neared the end of the corridor, we saw the last service facility: a grungy bar named Mick’s. Crude tables and a mattress lay scattered in the traffic corridor in front of the entrance. Some simple barricades, constructed of plywood and sawhorses, had been set up across the corridor beyond the bar. The word TOLL was spray-painted across the plywood. Beyond the barrier, it looked like someone had ripped off a metal security door and engaged in a drunken fight with an elevator’s hydraulics inside. The doorway was now venting a steady cloud of vapor. 

Our approach did not go unnoticed. Three young men were nursing tall cans of high gravity malt liquor at a lopsided table just outside the bar. One of them gave a low shout inside. Then all three left their tall cans behind and stepped toward us in their tight shiny pants. One of them smoothed back his greasy hair. Each of the three rested a hand on the pistol that he wore low-slung at his waist.   

Behind them, four more armed barflies slunk out and blearily stood near the doorway. 
  
"Oh, oh, oh!" said the slick-haired lounger approaching us. "Where you headed? Cause, like the sign say, there be a toll if you be heading that way.”  He stopped in front of us, feet apart, and jerked a thumb over his shoulder. 

Now I could’ve asked how much the toll was.  Or I could have offered to buy everyone a round.  Maybe there are other ways the conversation could’ve gone. 

But I’ve dealt with enough spaceport scum to know that conversation is just the warm-up banter before a beating. No sense giving them the advantage of time for their friends to fan out around us. 

I glanced meaningfully at the two smiling K‘Erins on either side of me and at the armored bot cradling a military rifle behind them. Simon and Twitch also had their hands on their guns. 

The lounger glanced back at his now ten other friends. At least two of them looked like tough customers. His eyes flicked back to us, and he chewed on his lower lip.

I caught his gaze and held it. "No deal,” I said. “Which means you’re now going to need to put up or shut up. Which is it going to be?”
