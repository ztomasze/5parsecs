### Ship's Log

#### Battle

+ Parking lot battle as our target comes out of an office building with his new mercenary security detail
+ Julie goes down to their opening salvo!
+ Down to only our quarry left... when a big boss merc comes out of the building 
+ Gizmo smokes the entrance while Billie runs in.  Shotgun (sandwich!) blasts ensue in the smoke while the rest of us run towards the final battle.
+ The body  morphs into an alien form and then disintegrates before the eyes of Billie and Jean.  What was that thing? And no body, no bounty!
