### Captain's Log

I woke early the next morning to find Billie and Jean already in the sims training again. They were both running advanced fire-avoidance combat programs. I’m pretty sure that all of the combat statistical model descriptions went right over Billie’s head, but he was a natural talent, and all of the simulated crossfire missed his head too. Jean’s eyes were focused in concentration as she memorized the most common opening fire patterns, and the safest response to each.

Gizmo and R9 were out trading for supplies again, this time hunting for fuel in case the mysterious bounty on Mr. Kowalski took us off world. R9 found a good deal on 2 standard units, but Gizmo scored a military fuel cell someone was trying to get rid of on the cheap. He didn’t ask where it came from.

I went out looking for another job to earn us some more credits in the meantime. Chirp’s cabin door was closed when walked by, and I didn’t want to bother him to ask his former employer for another job so soon after completing the previous one. After a few hours sorting through posting boards and messaging a few promising leads, I got an encrypted message back from a sourcing firm that does a lot of work with Spacebus, the third largest aerospace company in the galaxy. They have a research campus here, and they wanted someone to discretely take pictures of a new project at Haechi Heavy Industries. Haechi had splashed out a huge sum of credits to hire a team of Precursor academics who were the leading experts on quantum wave fusion manifold propulsion (or something like that). We’d join a public tour of the Haechi Heavy Industries factory, drop off the back when no one was looking, take a few pictures of the new engine prototype in the adjacent hangar, then rejoin the tour. Easy in, easy out.
