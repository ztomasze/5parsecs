_Trying to remember what we'd come up with for the scenario.  Refined and set up.  Discussed Savvy options a lot post-battle._

### Battle

We dropped into the Trellium wilds about 6 clicks from anywhere. We unloaded and fanned out around the mechanic as she led us toward the tower. 

We expected the attack, but somehow it was still a surprise. Still, our three snipers raised their rifles and all three of the ferals carrying auto-rifles were blown back into the surrounding vegetation.  Although some of the other ferals wavered at that, their K'Erin leader growled and bounced two shots off of Rosey. The ferals steeled themselves and rushed forward.

Khanjar barreled through the bushes and caught seven ferals in a blast of flame.  Only three of them caught fire and none of them dropped. Khanda and I provided some cover fire. While the three burning feral's scattered, the K'Erin merc ducked my shot and then shot Khanjar. Khanjar blinked in surprise at this honorless ranged assault.

Our snipers continued picking off ferals through the haze of smoke and burning fur. I glanced back and saw Ben-E step out of the bushes behind us. Without a word, he pulled a machine pistol from Simon's hip and started firing at ferals. His support was appreciated, but I also felt just a twinge of Twitch's unease as the muzzle flashes reflected off of Ben-E's expressionless faceplate.

Then Rosey's jet boots ignited and she lept past us. She came down with a wide puddle with a splash, and her machine pistol shots rained down on the K'Erin leader. Khanjar rushed at him, but just before he got there, Khanda put a bullet in the leader's head. Khanjar vented his rage on a feral grunt just beyond the leader instead.

Simon and I dropped a couple more ferals, and I yelled a go-ahead to the mechanic.  She ran toward the tower, ducking low through the vegetation. A moment later, she called back: "Clear! Oh shit… Valdar mine!"  The mechanic reappeared, eyes wide as she sprinted back towards us. "It's trapped!" she yelled.

We were suddenly on a time limit.  A Valdar mine would pulverise all biomass in a 100 foot radius but leave any weapons or electronics intact.

I needn't have worried. A final brutal round of fire, Rosey and Khanda dropped a feral each, while Khanjar drove a sword in each of a flaming feral's kidneys. 

We turned, and sprinted down the hill after the mechanic seconds before the rippling warbling hum of the Valdar mine sounded behind us.

### Post-Battle

We went back to quickly pick over the battlefield. We found a jailbroken auto-rifle, and we pulled a working battle dress and two doses of Rage Out off of the dead K'Erin. 
  
We then flew the mechanic back to port and picked up our 7 credits.

It seems that Ben-E is capable enough in a battle if we ever need him (_+1 CS_), and Simon said he's going to watch his back a little closer from now on (_+1 reactions_).

I poked my head into Twitch's bunk to ask him about Ben-E's sudden appearance on the battlefield. "What, am I supposed to be babysitting him?" Twitch shot back. "I told him to get lost for a while. It let me focus for a while, without having to watch over my shoulder."  He gestured at the repair crate in the corner.  "See, I got an extra stealth armor patched up. I've also downloaded a med school training software upgrade for Rosey."
