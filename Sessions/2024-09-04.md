_Trying to remember what we'd come up with for the scenario.  Refined and set up.  Discussed Savvy options a lot post-battle._

### Battle

We dropped into the Trellium wilds about 6 clicks from anywhere. We unloaded and fanned out around the mechanic as she led us toward the tower. 

We expected the attack, but somehow it was still a surprise. Our three snipers snapped up their rifles and all three of the ferals carrying auto-rifles were blown back into the surrounding vegetation.  Although some of the other ferals wavered at that, their K'Erin leader growled and bounced two shots off of Rosey. The ferals steeled themselves and rushed forward.

Khanjar barreled through the bushes and caught seven ferals in a blast of flame.  Only three of them caught fire and none of them dropped. Khanda and I provided some cover fire. While the three burning feral's scattered, the K'Erin merc ducked my shot and then shot Khanjar. Khanjar blinked in surprise at this honorless ranged assault.

Our snipers continued picking off ferals through the haze of smoke and burning fur. I glanced back and saw Ben-E step out of the bushes behind us. Without a word, he pulled a machine pistol from Simon's hip and started firing at ferals. His support was appreciated, but I also felt just a twinge of Twitch's unease as the muzzle flashes reflected off of Ben-E's expressionless faceplate.

Then Rosey's jet boots ignited and she leapt past us. She came down in a wide puddle with a splash, and her machine pistol shots rained down on the K'Erin leader. Khanjar rushed at him, but just before he got there, Khanda put a bullet in the leader's head. Khanjar vented his rage on a feral grunt just beyond the leader instead.

Simon and I dropped a couple more ferals, and I yelled a go-ahead to the mechanic.  She ran toward the tower, ducking low through the vegetation. A moment later, she called back: "Clear! Oh shit… Valdar mine!"  The mechanic reappeared, eyes wide as she sprinted back towards us. "It's trapped!" she yelled.

We were suddenly on a time limit.  A Valdar mine would pulverize all biomass in a 100 foot radius but leave any weapons or electronics intact.

I needn't have worried. In a final brutal round of fire, Rosey and Khanda dropped a feral each, while Khanjar drove a sword in each of a flaming feral's kidneys. 

We turned, and sprinted down the hill after the mechanic seconds before the rippling warbling hum of the Valdar mine sounded behind us.

### Post-Battle

We went back to quickly pick over the battlefield. We found a jailbroken auto-rifle, and we pulled a working battle dress and two doses of Rage Out off of the dead K'Erin. 
  
We then flew the mechanic back to port and picked up our 7 credits.

It seems that Ben-E is capable enough in a battle if we ever need him (_+1 CS_), and Simon said he's going to watch his back a little closer from now on (_+1 reactions_).

I poked my head into Twitch's bunk to ask him about Ben-E's sudden appearance on the battlefield. "What, am I supposed to be babysitting him?" Twitch shot back. "I told him to get lost for a while. It let me focus for a bit, without having to watch over my shoulder."  He gestured at the repair crate in the corner.  "See, I got an extra stealth armor patched up. I've also downloaded a med school training software upgrade for Rosey."

When I got back to my own bunk, a blinking light showed that I had a waiting cortex message. It was a video of one of the stranger alien races found on the Fringe.  Manipulators have three hoofed feet, a stout furred body, and six to eight eye-bearing tentacles. This one knew of our recent mall battle, and it proposed joining our crew. Manipulators are believed to be able to tweak the flow of fate, but this one gave me a seedy *primitive* vibe. As we were in the thick of things right now, I wasn't ready to chance adding a desperate lonely manipulator to the crew. I deleted the message with an short but polite decline receipt.

## Turn #18

### World

In the morning, we turned to the usual tasks required to keep the Tail-End running.  

**Ben-E** and **Jone** spend the morning in *training* sims to prepare for future battles.  **Twitch** and **Rosey** hunkered down in Twitch's berth to *repair* a bipod and a combat armor from the crate of damaged gear. 

**Khanjar** wandered off somewhere for several hours.  We were starting to worry he'd got lost somewhere, but *(-story)* he eventually came back flushed green from exertion. He'd found a local gym that was also, apparently, a serious gossip mill. If we needed any one tracked down, Khanjar could get some tips for us.  He also demonstrated some tips he'd gathered regarding inverted vertical push-ups.

**I** followed up with the Civil Defense Authority on our recent *job*. They said they'd be willing to hire us again. It sounded like the paperwork and approvals required for regular work would be fairly *demanding*, but there wasn't any time pressure.

As I was considering the option, **Simon** and **Khanda** returned from a *trade* run with a tracker sight and bipod. I heard Simon tell Twitch that the ship's merchant link seemed to be on the fritz: It has accepted a trade for a single pawn chess piece that came with some garbled message *(+rumor)*.

### Job

"Pawn?" I asked, stepping out of my berth.  "Twitch, can you take a look at that message?"

A few minutes later, Twitch had decoded it. It included a crypto-coin payment of 1 credit.  The optional memo field of the crypto payment said "Extermination fee" and the Payer field said "The Path Forward".  The message also include a geo-coordinate about 3 click away and a time range that ended in about 16 hours.  Pulling up a Tellium XII map, I saw that the geo-coordinate was located on an elevation just beyond a Unity base.

"Suit up, everyone," I said. "Simon, work with Twitch to see if you two can figure out any more about where this message came from and how it reached us through the trade network.  Ben-E, you're with us today."

An hour later, we were pushing our way through the vegetation up a rocky incline. The light of the day was fading, and we were all panting hard in the thin atmosphere. 

Just as we reached a fence at the crest of the hill, there was a shimmer in the air ahead of us... and then another.  Out of the shimmers flew two creatures that each looked something like a large one-eyed piranha in a halo of razor-blade fins.  They dove toward us as more shimmers flickered around us.  

"Void rippers!" I yelled.
