_After missing a couple weeks due to Zach's DC trip followed by sickness, we set up in Trojan Horse (due to AIPCon).  Started the first round before dinner, and we wrapped up shortly after 9pm. Headed home before 10p._

### Battle

As the mercenary crew hefted their military rifles down the incline toward us, we moved over to put a large thicket between us and them. Simon let them know we meant business with a blast from his auto-rifle into the Carpthium gloom. On my wrist slate scanner, I saw their gunslinger leader dive for cover. 

"This salvage is already claimed. I suggest you return to your ship," I yelled into the dark.

"I suggest you kiss your ass goodbye," spit back the gunslinger.  In a lower tone, I caught him telling his crew to circle around us, "shoot to kill". He received thick chuckles in reply from his crew.  To my right, Khanjar looked up from his own wrist slate with a savage grin. He crouched down, drew his blades, and sprinted straight into the thicket.

There was a scream from the gunslinger on the far side of the ticket as Khanjar eviscerated him.  The gunslinger must have had a smoke grenade in hand because suddenly the air was thick with white dust. I heard roars from the merc crew, and the rest of us followed Khanjar into the ticket.  Blood had been spilled; these guys weren't going to back down.

I lit up our side of the thicket with my cling fire gun. Rosey dropped one of the mercs with a double-tap of her new stunning pistol.

I heard one of the mercs laugh, thinking he'd gotten the drop on Khanjar.  The laugh choked off into a wet gurgle along the edge of Khanjar's blade.  Twitch was suddenly on my left and dropped another merc with his pistol.  The one I'd flamed was screaming, running further ahead of us into the foggy thicket.  I heard Khanda's shotgun sound from behind me to the right, and then Khanjar's hunting growl as he closed in fast on the flaming merc.

Another merc came at us, though maybe he was just lost in the confusion. I hit him with a blast of cling-fire regardless. Rosey followed up with another double-tap, and he dropped.  I appreciated her attempt at nonlethal damage, but I could hear the merc's flesh still sizzling under the cling fire. The air smelled like a luau roast in a chemical factory, and I pulled my neck gaiter up to cover my nose.

A whoop from Khanjar let me know that the battle was already over.  We picked our way out of the thicket.  Twitch was lugging something heavy and metallic--it turns out he got to his salvage after all.

### Post-Battle

We did a quick sweep of the battlefield. We pulled a _tracker sight_ from the gunslinger, and Khanda grabbed a _personal trinket_ of some sort--dogtags, I think--from another.  We headed for their ship, but they must have left a pilot behind.  It took off before we could reach it, so we doubled back to our own. 
  
Everyone was jazzed with post-battle adrenaline on the flight back.  They recapped the battle to each other and shared tips from the _experience_. Simon said he thinks he's getting the hang of this auto rifle (_+combat skill_). Khanjar recounted the importance of a sprinting surprise by charging straight into the middle of an armed group (_+toughness_). Rosey wondered if she could have done more if she'd just processed the situation a little faster (_+reaction_).

When we landed, I checked the cortex. Bad news: It looks like that gunslinger was the estranged nephew of the sector governor!  They were already hot on our trail with a description of our ship, but (-_story point_) Twitch stayed up late to do some magic with our transponder. He managed to flip a single bit of the ship's ident code without frying the whole device.  He then hacked into the port registry to update our record there.  Now our recently recorded flight path wouldn't lead back to us.

In the morning, he told me he'd also noticed something in passing in the ship registry: There was a ship linked to the Blood Storm mercs that was assigned to one of the western space port docks here in Bacau. (_rumor_)
  
By late morning, the governor's fury at Carpathium's inability to find one ship led to an edict that no ship would be leaving the planet until the case was closed (_next 2 turns_).

## Turn #5

### World

**Twitch** slept in, earning some well-deserved rest. _Training_ sims don't really compare to the real-world hacking he'd done last night.  The kid's really getting _+savvy_.  **Khanda** hit the combat *training* sim, vaguely apologetic that she hadn't landed more shots during our recent battle. I think she prides herself on her control and her marksmanship, and she said the gloom of Carpathium 9 is getting to her.

**Khanjar**, on the other hand, loves this place.  He rolled out of bed at noon and sauntered off like a hunting lion to do some _exploring_.  He came back several hours later with fresh bruises, torn knuckles, and 1 credit that he got for selling one of our spare hand guns.

**Simon** and **Rosey** also went out to _trade_. I take it that they didn't go to our usual back-alley contacts. As they keyed open the boarding door on their return, I could hear Simon instructing Rosey on the basics of "supply and demand". Rosey carried a crate of novelty snow globes, which she assured me will recoup their nominal initial investment several times over on other planets. Simon had a selection of pricey liquors, cigars, and high-end preserves.  He explained that, aside from selling these at a high turnover like the snow globes, they'd also serve as a fine enticement for a recruiting event, when the time comes to expand "our current business venture."

### Job

Time again to run through our contacts for a fresh job.  Opening my cortex messages, some (_busy_) corporation promised a steady stream of low stress jobs (_this or next 2 turns_), but the pay wasn't great (_+1 credit_).

Of greater interest to me was another message from **Quenton Hyland**. Unlike his last offer, this one didn't need us to be clean.  He was willing to pay a little more (_+2 credits_), no rush (_this or next 2 turns_), on a job outside of Bacau.  Given the heat that could still come down on us if sector government tracked us to the spaceport, getting out of town for a while sounded good to me.

On the way over to meet Quenton, I stopped by DIRM to see Bosch. I handed over the sensor module. 

"Did you run into any… trouble along the way?" he asked pensively. 

"Do you really want to know?" I asked.

He stared into space for a moment.  "No," he said.  

Bosch authorized the payment transfer, and then he slid a box across his desk to me.  Lifting the lid, I found a new handgun and clip, still in their foam packaging. "From the special requisitions cache," Bosch said.
  
An hour later, I caught up with Quenton. He laid out the basics of the job.  A friend of his, who wished to remain anonymous, owned a villa on the outskirts of the rural town of **Medias**. Their clique would often fly out to party there. I could just imagine the details: A bunch of beautiful rich kids floating naked in the pool, popping cans of whiff or huff, doing lines of snowflake off the patio table, chasing each other through the house, and dancing to high-bass synth-pop until dawn.

However, it seemed that some of the locals weren't fans of synth-pop.  A contingent of ex-reservists and invasion preppers had come knocking, asking for donations to fund their local militia efforts "for the protection of the community". Quenton's friend refused. The well-muscled militia leader had said, "Well, if you can't afford a monetary donation, you can still contribute to the cause by providing us with a space to train. I see you've got a lot of land here, and it often goes unused." He turned and led his men away before Quenton's friend could reply.

The next time Quenton's group came out to the villa, they found the back lawn torn up, bullet holes in the palm trees, and a smashed rear window. There was a note: "We seem to have misplaced a couple of our landmines during our last training exercise.  Are you sure you wouldn't like to make a financial contribution after all?"
  
Quenton said that his friend tried contacting the local authorities, but it seems they favored the militia in this little dispute.  With a snicker, the officer said, "Perhaps you'd like us to come out and sweep your villa closely for any signs of… contraband?"

Quenton explained, "You've already proven yourself effective with dealing with people like this. My friend is asking you to head out to the villa and convince these _militia_ gentlemen that they do not wish to visit the villa premises ever again." (_fight off / hold the field_)

He handed me a contract to sign and then transferred me a copy. My crew was now officially on villa security detail, authorized by the owner to clear the premises.

I headed back to the Tail-End, and we flew out to Medias.  For dramatic effect, Khanda brought us in low over the villa. Our jetwash shook the windows, toppled the patio furniture, and blasted some of the water out of the pool.  As we set down just past the patch of grapevines, several men in dark fatigues emerged from inside the house and from the back few acres and ran toward defensive positions. It looked like they'd really settled in here (_bitter struggle - +1 morale_). They carried military rifles and an auto rifle, but not expertly.

I turned to my crew. "Time to go out and talk to the local yokels."  Khanjar fingered the hilt of his blade and grinned.

“No,” I said. “We need to keep this clean and legal. A nice tight ‘stand your ground’ defense. Twitch, Rosey, I want this recorded. Get some cams and a snooper going. And nobody”—I locked eyes with each crew member in turn—"Nobody attacks them until they shoot first!”
