### Ship's Log

#### Battle

+ As we investigate a ship loading dock for a secretive org, we uncover a squad of Converted!
+ 0) We seize the initiative and advance in a spread out formation, hiding behind different shipping crates..
+ 1) Chirp dashes for the tallest point while the Converted close in.  Billie charges in. R9 blasts three shot into one of the Converted and only dents him. 
+ 2) Gizmo opens up with a stun grenade, dropping one of them.  Julie and Jean move up and drop more with concentrated fire. Billie runs in and kills another, cleaving into the boss and wounding him. Shots come in, and Billie luckily dives for cover, but gets blasted back with a shockwave. The boss misses Billie with his hand cannon. A shot misses Captain. R9 and Chirp both work on grunt pack in the back corner.
+ 3) Jean blasts the back left group, and Gizmo tosses a stun grenade to further soften them up. Julie drops the boss, while Billie dives into the grenaded pack to kill two of them.  R9 takes a couple shots, drops one, and gets shockwaved back in reply. Three of the enemies jump back up, including the boss. Chirp puts 2 stuns on a hyperblaster.
+ 4) R9 and Chirp lay down some covering fire on their side, and takes some fire in return. Jean blasts a bunch on the other side. The boss leaps up and shoots Julie point-blank. Billie kills one and cleaves into another grunt, wounding him. Gizmo disables the boss.  Reinforcements appear below Chirp!
+ 5) Jean comes for the middle group, and Gizmo follows up with a stun grenade.  R9 ends and time distorts the reinforcements. Chirp executes the last one in that group.  Julie pours some damage onto the boss, flashing off his armor. Billie leaps on a grunt. Shots on Billie and a stalemate melee on Jean. 2 enemies respawn.  There's a dangerous creaking under Chirp.
+ 6) Julie and Jean kill the boss. R9 and a gliding-down Chirp heavily stun another, which Julie kills.  R9 executes the one that comes for him.  More shots are traded. Billie kills two more. Gizmo shoots his gun off.  One respawns.
+ 7) Gizmo opens with a grenade on the unfrozen reinforcements.  R9 and Chirp go for the back left. Shots on Jean, which she luckily dodges. Julie gets stunned in melee. Billie kills one in melee. Jean stuns the incoming reinforcements. 
+ 8) Julie takes out the last straggler and we all turn on the stunned reinforcements. Jean takes one of them out and stuns another, Billie shotguns another.  R9 stuns the last one in a hail of fire, and Gizmo kills it.  The one behind us stands up. Chirp turns and stuns it. Another environmental hazard. 
+ 9) Captain pours 3 stuns on it, and Jean kills it. It stands up again. R9 pours 3 stuns into, and Chirp stuns it out.  It stands up again!  Event: R9 puts free shots on it.
+ 10) R9 keeps pour into it. It respawns!  It goes down again. And gets up again! Event: Renewed effort.
+ 11) We kill it again. For real this time!

*We killed the last one on the board 6 times!*
