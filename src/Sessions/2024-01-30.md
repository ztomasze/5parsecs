*After some MtG booster pack opening, we played our first battle and completed a full turn cycle. Took us until 11p.*

> On: [[Carpathium 9]]
### Battle

We tossed the heavy cases of whiff to the Khans.  They cut to the left, while the rest of us headed to the brighter area near a power substation.  Simon peeked around the corner and called out to the gangers for directions to the nearest rail station, perhaps in exchange for some coin.  The gangers whooped and hollered as they closed in on him.

The Khans were able to catch the eye of one of them as they wove among the parked cars. The ganger peeled off from the group.  In the gloom, Khanjar opened him up, spilling his guts onto the street.

The rest of us pulled back, drawing the gangers after us. Perhaps in another timeline, Rosey would have engaged them in a brutal exchange of gunfire, but, in this one, she kept to the mission of keeping us safe. 

While posturing, the Claw swung his power claw into a nearby spaceport dock pillar. Although the arcing sparks were indeed intimidating, the electric blowback and the masonry dislodged from above falling onto one of his ganger companions were less so. We used the distraction to duck back into an alley and start running.  

With Twitch's eye in the sky, we confirmed over the vox that we were clear.  The Khans hurried ahead and made the delivery while Rosey, Simon, and I circled back to the rail station and rode home.
### Post-Battle

With the successful drop, we made a total of 6 credits from Mr. Golinko. On the way home, the Khans _purchased_ a shotgun and pistol. This battle proved that [[Carpathium 9]] is just too gloomy to make good use of the colony rifles we have.  Khanda also got a great deal on a flak screen (_loot_).

When we got back to the _Tailend_, Twitch had been making some deals with some of our stray cargo and had earned us another 3 credits. I reinstalled the ignition crystals while the crew was busy with other tasks.

Unlike the rest of us, Khanjar seems to be particularly enjoying Carp 9. He's like a panther, feeding well in the dark of the jungle. I hope his confidence will see him through should his luck change (_negate one future injury roll_).

## Turn #2

### World

After resting up for a day, it was time for another job.
  
**Simon** was a little shook up by the raw violence of our last job, so he and **Khanjar** ran through some combat sims together (_train_).  The rest of us headed out to hunt for another job and some decent gear.
### Job

**I** took **Rosey** with me while paying a visit to Mr. Golinko.  His majordomo said there was another task that we could take on.  It would pay okay, but it was urgent and it sounded dangerous.  I said I'd reply in an hour after confirming with my crew.

As I exited the elevator in the lobby, I found Rosey talking to three youths.  _Youth_ seems to describe them best: a girl and two guys, all with long hair and casually flowing silky clothes.  Rich aspiring revolutionaries.  

It turns out they were members of **PETAL** (People for the Ethical Treatment of Artificial Life).  Ever eager to mingle with the oppressed proletariat, they'd started chatting up Rosey.  When they learned she was a freelancer, they were even more eager.  

We retired to a dimly lit booth in a nearby coffeehouse.  They refused to give their names--only obvious aliases--but they explained that they might have a job for us. 

A local corp, **OmegaGen Biotech**, has been making strides in replicant technology, including vat-grown bio-synthetics. This stuff is fringe AL. It's not clear if it's a lifeform at all, since it's all non-embryo. Normally bio-synth is just used for organ replacement, augments, or protein meal replacement.  But eventually this always comes back to the gray area of patchwork creature construction.  This case sounded fairly benign: expanding the exotic pet trade. But then the girl clarified with a blush that she'd said _erotic_, not _exotic_.  Basically, a synth version of [[Garthon 4]]'s sex weasels. An abuse of Artificial Life in every sense of the word.

But their knowledge of OmegaGen's latest product was still just rumor at this point.  They needed proof.  Yet they deemed hacking, theft, or break-in too risky.  I could see that even talking to us was already making them nervous.  The bearded guy kept wiping his forehead, taking small sips from his drink, and looking over my shoulder at the door. He assured me twice that this would be a _one-time job_, with no further contact afterward.

What we settled on is that our crew would install some simple commodity open-band broadcast cameras in the OmegaGen lab. Then PETAL would be able to pick up the feed from across the street, with just enough plausible deniability. It sounded weak to me, but the pay they were offering was significant for such a simple job. I kept my mouth shut.

The one challenge to this job would be the security forces. OmegaGen's labs were in an indoor research park--something like a cross between an office building, a hospital, and a shopping mall.  A handful of different biotech corps were housed there.  While all were low-risk labs, they all prized their trade secrets. They paid a security firm known for hiring retired combat _veterans_.

I said we'd take the job. Rosey and I swung by Mr. Golinko's building on the way home to decline his offer.
### World (cont.)

Back at the ship, we caught up with **Twitch** and **Khanda**. They'd spent the afternoon scrounging among the scrapper booths, looking for _trade_ deals.  Twitch found a broken beam light gun mod that would be useful in the gloom, and Khanda found some spare parts to help with the repairs.   

Khanda then pulled me aside: "I also saw a holster with the Blood Storm logo on it. The scrapper couldn't remember who sold it, but he knew it came in within the past week from the carnage of a substack shootout.  The intel was right: They're here!"  (_quest_)
### Job (cont.)

We rode the late night rail out to the biotech labs. We wore baggy clothes, and we pulled on some balaclavas as we approached the lab entrance and eyed the exterior mounted cameras. The lights were all off inside. Twitch flipped the lock in seconds and we quickly moved inside. 

The plan was to make this fast: In and out before anyone got hurt. Make it look like an interrupted robbery--nothing broken, nothing stolen. No harm, no foul.  We just needed a few seconds unobserved to _secure_ one of the cameras we carried among us.
  
We were halfway to the OmegaGen lab when our element of _surprise_ ran out.  We heard the alarm sound and the gruff calls of three security enforcers as they moved through the building to head us off.
